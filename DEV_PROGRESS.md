### Wave 1 — what's actually left

The audit confirmed Wave 1 was 90% done before today:
- 1.1 — promoted to Wave 0.1 (done)
- 1.2-1.8 — frontend polish series, all done 2026-04-05
- Behavioral workspaces (7) — wired today end-to-end (engine + UI category + banner + greyed cards)

**Only one thing remains in Wave 1:**

### 1.9 Stage D — Selective Headless

**Spec**: see [docs/ROADMAP.md § 1.9](docs/ROADMAP.md). Short version:

- [workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts:420-424](workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts#L420) is a placeholder comment block. The pipeline jumps from Stage C (`crawl`) directly to `complete` even when `spaDetected === true`.
- All building blocks already exist:
  - SPA detection ([line 386](workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts#L386))
  - `BrowserWorker` ([workers/verification/browser-worker.ts](workers/verification/browser-worker.ts)) — has both real Playwright execution and a simulated CI fallback, returns `Evidence[]`, implements `VerificationExecutor`
  - `PlaywrightRuntime` is the canonical browser layer
  - Verification policy gating (Wave 0.6) — Stage D should reuse it for cost protection
- The wiring task is small (~50-100 lines): when `spaDetected`, build a minimal `BrowserVerificationRequest`, execute via `BrowserWorker.execute()`, append the resulting `Evidence[]` to the cycle. Stage D should be **selective** (cost protection) — only run for SPA-detected sites or other ambiguity triggers.

**Estimated effort**: ~3-4 hours including:
- The wiring itself
- Plumbing the verification policy through Stage D so a budget-exhausted cycle doesn't blow up
- Test coverage (the simulated mode of BrowserWorker makes this easy)
- Manual verification on a known SPA test site
- Adjacent flow check: confirm the new evidence flows through to findings + workspaces correctly

### Loose ends parked / deferred

| Item | Why deferred | When to revisit |
|---|---|---|
| Sprint 3.12 — Refactor onboard form to use shared form fields | 872 lines, "cosmetic" but the surface area is large enough that it could regress the onboard flow at exactly the wrong time. Risk-to-value ratio is bad pre-Wave-1. | After Wave 1 ships and we have a bit of slack |
| Mobile classifier in Wave 0.3 | Currently uses User-Agent regex (good enough). Snippet emitting `device_type` directly would be cleaner. | Wave 2 or 3, when we touch the snippet for other reasons |
| `/api/inventory` mocked deltas (`page.tsx:454`) | Shows a TODO comment. Period-over-period stat needs new API support. Not blocking. | Wave 2 along with the other inventory polish |
| `integration_pull` executor placeholder ([executors.ts:207](workers/verification/executors.ts#L207)) | Wave 3 scope per ROADMAP. Returns "not yet implemented" cleanly today. | Wave 3 |

### Known limitations to keep in mind

- **Behavioral workspaces "active with 0 findings"**: a card can be eligible (≥20 sessions) but show 0 issues if specific cohort signals didn't fire (e.g. all-organic traffic → no `paid_traffic_*` signals). Renders as `0 issues`. Could improve with a "monitoring" badge — out of Wave 1 scope.
- **Eligibility confidence reverse-engineering**: the `pixel_progress` shown in `collecting` cards is reverse-engineered from `eligibility.confidence` (`min(1, sessionCount/100)`). Above 100 sessions we lose precision. Not a problem in practice because `collecting` only triggers below 20 sessions.
- **In-memory verification state** (Wave 0.6): verification results live only in the in-memory MCP singleton. On a multi-process deployment, other processes won't see new evidence until next cycle. We're single-instance on Railway today so this doesn't bite, but worth knowing.

### Manual configuration that's now in place (no action needed)

- ✅ `RawBehavioralEvent` table in production (Wave 0.2)
- ✅ `CycleSnapshot` + `Finding` tables in production (Wave 0.7)
- ✅ All cron jobs registered in `instrumentation-node.ts`: heal cron (60s), lead cleanup + behavioral prune (1h), behavioral rate-limit prune (5min)
- ⚠️ **Postgres password rotation**: the `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL` was pasted into chat history during Wave 0.2 push. Recommended to rotate in Railway when convenient.

### How to start Wave 1 in the next session

1. Read this section + the ROADMAP § 1.9 spec
2. Review [workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts:420-424](workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts#L420) to confirm the slot is still where I described
3. Review [workers/verification/browser-worker.ts](workers/verification/browser-worker.ts) execute interface — that's what Stage D will call
4. Decide on the minimal scenario shape (visit homepage + scroll + capture) and the cost-gating policy
5. Implement, test, manually verify on a known SPA test site

## Behavioral Workspaces Wire-Up -- 2026-04-07

### Goal

Light up the 7 pixel-dependent workspaces (First Impression Revenue, Action Value Map, Acquisition Integrity, Mobile Revenue Exposure, Friction Tax, Trust Revenue Gap, Path to Purchase Efficiency) and present them under a new **Behavioral** category in the workspaces page, with greyed-out placeholders + a yellow "Configure Vestigio pixel" banner when pixel data isn't available yet.

### Key insight from the audit

Before writing any code I audited the 11 engine layers from the original plan in `~/.claude/plans/ticklish-discovering-nova.md`. **11 of the 12 layers were already implemented** in some prior sprint:

- ✅ `BehavioralCohortPayload` types ([packages/behavioral/types.ts:370](packages/behavioral/types.ts#L370))
- ✅ `aggregateCohorts()` reducer ([packages/behavioral/session-aggregator.ts:619](packages/behavioral/session-aggregator.ts#L619))
- ✅ 21 inference functions wired into the main pipeline ([packages/inference/engine.ts:180-200](packages/inference/engine.ts#L180))
- ✅ Cohort signal extractor with 21 signals + division-by-zero guards ([packages/signals/engine.ts:3904](packages/signals/engine.ts#L3904))
- ✅ 7 decision question keys × 4 tiers = 28 decision keys ([packages/decision/engine.ts:201-292](packages/decision/engine.ts#L201))
- ✅ `createBehavioralWorkspace()` factory with all 7 mappings ([packages/workspace/behavioral-workspace.ts:62](packages/workspace/behavioral-workspace.ts#L62))
- ✅ Impact baselines for all 21 inferences with high/medium/low ranges
- ✅ `isBehavioralPackEligible()` + `PackEligibility.behavioral_workspaces` field
- ✅ `recomputeAll()` loop producing the 7 behavioral packs ([recompute.ts:321-369](packages/workspace/recompute.ts#L321))
- ✅ `projectWorkspaces` mapping the 7 packs to projections ([projections/engine.ts:957](packages/projections/engine.ts#L957))
- ✅ i18n: workspace names in en/pt-BR/es

The whole edifice was just sitting dormant because of **3 small wiring gaps** that the original plan didn't account for. Found them by reading the signal extractor's bail-out condition and following the data flow backwards.

### What was actually missing

**Gap 1**: `extractBehavioralCohortSignals` looks for evidence with `payload.type === 'behavioral_cohort'`, but Wave 0.3 only emitted `'behavioral_session'`. Without the cohort payload, all 21 cohort signals silently skipped → 21 inferences silently skipped → 7 workspaces silently empty.

**Gap 2**: `recompute.ts:290` called `computePackEligibility(classification, null, null)` — `behavioralContext` was hard-coded to `null`. Result: `pack_eligibility.behavioral_workspaces.eligible` was always false, so the projection layer's eligibility check would have fought against the data even after Gap 1 was fixed.

**Gap 3**: `projectFindings`'s pack-eligibility if-else chain didn't have cases for the 7 behavioral pack keys. Cosmetic with the existing empty-pack filter, but a load-bearing invariant once placeholder workspaces ship (because then findings DO exist for behavioral packs even when not eligible).

Plus the user's UX requirement added gaps **4-7**: workspaces page is flat with no categories, `WorkspaceProjection` has no `category` field, `projectWorkspaces` filters out empty packs (so placeholders never make it to the UI), and there's no banner system.

### What changed

**Phase A — engine fixes**

[apps/audit-runner/process-behavioral.ts](apps/audit-runner/process-behavioral.ts) — emit a second Evidence entry carrying `BehavioralCohortPayload` alongside the env-level `BehavioralSessionPayload`. Both ride on `evidence_type=BehavioralSession`; the signal extractors discriminate on `payload.type`. New: User-Agent regex device classifier (`/Mobi|Android|iPhone|iPad|iPod|Opera Mini|IEMobile/i`) so mobile vs desktop cohorts split meaningfully without snippet changes. The classifier reads from a `Map<sessionId, userAgent>` populated during the row grouping pass.

[packages/workspace/recompute.ts](packages/workspace/recompute.ts) — detect behavioral evidence in the `evidence` array (both flavors: env-level via `session_count` and cohort-level via `total_session_count`), then pass `{ hasBehavioralEvidence, sessionCount }` as the `behavioralContext` argument to `computePackEligibility`. Now `pack_eligibility.behavioral_workspaces` reflects reality.

[packages/projections/engine.ts](packages/projections/engine.ts) — added 7 new cases to the `projectFindings` if-else for the behavioral pack keys (`first_impression_revenue`, `action_value_map`, `acquisition_integrity`, `mobile_revenue_exposure`, `friction_tax`, `trust_revenue_gap`, `path_efficiency`). Findings under these packs now respect `pack_eligibility.behavioral_workspaces.eligible`.

**Phase B — projection placeholders**

[packages/projections/types.ts](packages/projections/types.ts) — added three new fields to `WorkspaceProjection`:

- `category: 'core' | 'behavioral'` — UI grouping bucket
- `pixel_status: 'unconfigured' | 'collecting' | 'active' | null` — null for core, drives the greyed/active rendering for behavioral
- `pixel_progress: { current; required } | null` — lets the UI show "12/20 sessions"

[packages/projections/engine.ts projectWorkspaces](packages/projections/engine.ts#L957) — refactored the behavioral loop to **always emit all 7 cards**, even when the pack is null or has zero findings. Pixel status is derived from `result.pack_eligibility.behavioral_workspaces`:

- `eligible: true` → `pixel_status = 'active'` (real findings flowing)
- `eligible: false` AND `confidence > 0` → `pixel_status = 'collecting'` (snippet installed but < 20 sessions); `pixel_progress` is reverse-engineered from the eligibility's confidence (which is `min(1, sessionCount/100)`)
- `eligible: false` AND `confidence === 0` → `pixel_status = 'unconfigured'` (snippet not installed)

Cards without an active pack get neutral fallback decision text (`${type}_no_data`) and zero findings — the UI handles the rest.

**Phase C — UI categories + banner + greyed cards**

[src/app/(console)/workspaces/page.tsx](src/app/(console)/workspaces/page.tsx) — refactored from a flat grid into two `<CategorySection>`s:

- **Core** (preflight, revenue, chargeback, saas) — unchanged behavior
- **Behavioral** (the 7 new cards) — yellow banner above when all 7 are `unconfigured`, blue informational banner when at least one is `collecting`, no banner when at least one is `active`

The original card rendering was extracted into a `<WorkspaceCard>` component with two variants:

- **Active**: original 4-stat grid (monthly loss, issues, confidence, top issue) + optional confidence narrative + checkbox
- **Locked**: dashed border, muted opacity, no checkbox, pixel status badge instead of stats. Click goes to `/app/settings/data-sources` instead of the workspace detail page

The other workspaces route (`src/app/app/workspaces/page.tsx`) is a re-export of `(console)/workspaces/page` so the refactor covers both.

[dictionary/en.json](dictionary/en.json), [dictionary/pt-BR.json](dictionary/pt-BR.json), [dictionary/es.json](dictionary/es.json) — new keys:

- `console.workspaces.categories.core` / `.behavioral`
- `console.workspaces.categories.behavioral_locked_banner`
- `console.workspaces.categories.behavioral_collecting_banner`
- `console.workspaces.categories.configure_pixel_cta`
- `console.workspaces.pixel_status.unconfigured` / `.collecting` / `.active`

### Adjacent flows verified

- **Cold start without pixel data**: behavioral workspaces still render as the 7 greyed-out cards under the Behavioral category. The UI now has a path to direct users to set up the snippet — previously they'd see nothing for these workspaces at all.
- **First audit cycle, snippet just installed, no events yet**: cohort emission produces an empty payload, eligibility says `eligible: false, confidence: 0`, all 7 cards render as `unconfigured`. Banner = locked yellow.
- **Snippet installed, < 20 sessions**: eligibility says `eligible: false, confidence: 0.X`, all 7 cards render as `collecting` with progress badge. Banner = collecting blue.
- **Snippet installed, ≥ 20 sessions**: eligibility says `eligible: true`. Cards render normally (but still all 7 — even those with 0 findings, since the placeholder loop always emits them). No banner.
- **Mobile classifier**: regex on User-Agent stored in `RawBehavioralEvent.userAgent` (Wave 0.2 already captures it). Imperfect but covers the major mobile browsers, and the cohort signals only fire when mobile + desktop both have ≥ 10 sessions, so a few miss-classifications don't poison the inference.
- **Cycle-to-cycle change detection**: behavioral findings flow through the same Wave 0.7 snapshot/finding persistence path as everything else, so `change_class` lights up automatically.
- **Verification**: behavioral findings can be verified via the Wave 0.6 endpoint (no additional wiring needed — the verify route operates on `action_id` regardless of pack).

### Files touched

- [apps/audit-runner/process-behavioral.ts](apps/audit-runner/process-behavioral.ts) — cohort emission + device classifier
- [packages/workspace/recompute.ts](packages/workspace/recompute.ts) — pass behavioralContext to computePackEligibility
- [packages/projections/engine.ts](packages/projections/engine.ts) — 7 if-else cases + always-emit behavioral cards
- [packages/projections/types.ts](packages/projections/types.ts) — `category` + `pixel_status` + `pixel_progress` fields
- [src/app/(console)/workspaces/page.tsx](src/app/(console)/workspaces/page.tsx) — Core/Behavioral sections, banner, locked card variant
- [dictionary/en.json](dictionary/en.json), [dictionary/pt-BR.json](dictionary/pt-BR.json), [dictionary/es.json](dictionary/es.json) — categories + pixel_status keys

### Manual verification

1. Open `/app/workspaces` on an env that has no pixel data → see 4 Core cards rendering normally + a Behavioral section with 7 dashed/greyed cards + the yellow "Configure Vestigio pixel" banner above them
2. Click any greyed card → navigates to `/app/settings/data-sources` (the snippet install page)
3. Install the snippet on a test site, generate < 20 sessions → reload `/app/workspaces` → banner switches to blue "collecting", cards show progress badge "X / 20 sessions"
4. Generate 20+ sessions → cards activate, banner disappears, real findings start appearing on the cards that have them, the rest stay visible but with 0 findings (placeholder still emitted)

### Limitations / known follow-ups

- **Mobile classifier is approximate**: regex on User-Agent. A snippet upgrade that emits `device_type` directly would be more reliable (would also let us detect tablets and bots). Documented inline.
- **Active workspaces with 0 findings**: pacing mechanism kicks in — a card can be "active" (eligible) but show 0 findings if the cohort signals didn't fire (e.g., insufficient paid traffic for acquisition_integrity even though total sessions is 100+). The UI still renders these as active cards with `0 issues`. Not a bug — it's the engine correctly saying "monitoring, no problems detected" — but the UX could be improved by showing a "monitoring" badge for that case. Out of scope for this commit.
- **Inferred session count from confidence**: the eligibility's confidence is `min(1, sessionCount/100)`, so above 100 sessions we lose precision. The UI reads `pixel_progress` to show "X/20" but only when status is `collecting`, which by definition means sessionCount < 20 ≪ 100, so this lossy reverse-engineering is fine in practice.

## Wave 0.3 + 0.5 closure -- 2026-04-07 -- Pixel Event Processing Worker

### Goal

Wave 0.2 made the snippet's events stick to disk in `RawBehavioralEvent`. Wave 0.3 closes the loop: read those events back, run the existing `aggregateSession()` per session, reduce N session aggregates into one `BehavioralSessionPayload`, and emit it as `Evidence` so the engine sees behavioral data on the very next recompute. Then — as a small bonus closing Wave 0.5 properly — wire `/api/inventory` to read distinct sessionId-per-URL counts so the inventory page finally shows real `session_count` instead of `null`.

This is the moment all 7 behavioral workspaces from `~/.claude/plans/ticklish-discovering-nova.md` become eligible to ship: the eligibility gate is `session_count >= 20` and now there's a real path for that to be true.

### Architecture decision: inline in audit-runner

I considered three architectures and went with the simplest:

- **Option A (chosen)**: process pixel events inline in `apps/audit-runner/run-cycle.ts` right before `recomputeAll()`. The cycle's evidence pool gains a `BehavioralSessionPayload` and the engine pass picks it up immediately.
- **Option B**: standalone cron that processes events every N minutes and persists evidence to a synthetic "live" cycle. Rejected because it requires inventing a fake cycle ref and creates race conditions with the audit-runner.
- **Option C**: process events on-demand from the API layer. Rejected because the engine context is built once per cycle, so on-demand processing wouldn't actually help anyone.

Option A wins because:

1. The `cycle_ref` is already known and natural to attribute the evidence to
2. The new evidence flows straight into the same recompute → projection → snapshot → finding chain that already exists
3. No race conditions with snapshot/findings persistence
4. No extra cron, no extra moving parts
5. Pixel data refreshes whenever an audit runs (which is when the user is actively looking at the data anyway)

The downside (pixel data only "lights up" when an audit runs) is acceptable for V1 — audits run at least daily for active envs. If we later want continuous behavioral updates we can add an out-of-band cron without disturbing this path.

### Time window

Every cycle re-aggregates the **last 30 days** of events for the env. `processedAt` is set on touched rows but is informational only — it does not gate the read query. Old events are deleted by the receivedAt-based prune in [src/instrumentation-node.ts](src/instrumentation-node.ts).

This windowed-not-incremental approach means each cycle's behavioral payload is a fresh, complete picture of the last 30 days, not a delta since the previous cycle. Simpler to reason about, simpler to test, and the engine's existing eligibility gate (`session_count >= 20`) handles low-data envs gracefully.

### The reducer

[apps/audit-runner/process-behavioral.ts](apps/audit-runner/process-behavioral.ts) — pure function `sessionsToBehavioralPayload(sessions: SessionAggregate[]): BehavioralSessionPayload`.

This is the only place that translates the per-session vocabulary into the env-level payload the engine expects. ~50 fields covering counts, rates, milestone propagation, average durations (skipping null contributors), CTA engagement, oscillation pairs (order-independent collapse), top-N kinds, handoff continuity, stalled step heuristic, and checkout immediate-abandon detection.

Notable details:

- **Milestone cascade via switch fallthrough**: a session at `conversion_completed` also counts toward every prior milestone (awareness → consideration → intent → conversion_started). This matches funnel semantics.
- **Oscillation pair canonicalization**: `[a, b]` and `[b, a]` collapse to one bucket via `[a, b].sort().join("||")`.
- **Top-N selection**: top 5 oscillation pairs by count, top 3 sensitive abandon kinds. Avoids unbounded growth.
- **Stalled step heuristic**: a surface that ends ≥3 non-converting sessions counts as 1 stalled. Fast, deterministic, no per-pair calibration.
- **Checkout immediate abandon**: `checkout_reached AND duration < 30s AND !reached_thank_you`. Crude but useful as a "hot leave" signal.
- **Mobile metrics stay zero for now** because the snippet doesn't yet emit `device_type`. Documented inline. The engine handles 0 gracefully and will not penalize the env for missing data — eligibility gates the metric.

### Tests

[tests/process-behavioral.test.ts](tests/process-behavioral.test.ts) — 10 focused tests on the pure reducer:

- empty input returns zero payload (no NaN, no nulls in wrong places)
- counts and rates correct
- milestone cascade through funnel taxonomy
- avg time skips null contributors
- oscillation pairs collapse order-independent and aggregate
- top-N kind selection
- checkout immediate abandon heuristic
- stalled step heuristic
- CTA engagement rate + dead CTA detection
- handoff continuity counters

All 10 pass. Full project suite (14 suites) still passes.

### Wiring into the audit-runner

[apps/audit-runner/run-cycle.ts](apps/audit-runner/run-cycle.ts) — inserted between "Resolve business inputs" and "(b) Engine":

```ts
const behavioral = await processBehavioralEventsForEnv(
  env.id,
  { workspace_ref, environment_ref, subject_ref, path_scope: null },
  cycleRefStr,
);
if (behavioral.evidence.length > 0) {
  result.evidence.push(...behavioral.evidence);
  // Also persist to PrismaEvidenceStore so cold-start rehydration sees it
  await new PrismaEvidenceStore(prisma).addMany(behavioral.evidence);
}
```

Critical detail: the original `store.addMany(result.evidence)` happens earlier in step 5, BEFORE behavioral processing. So I added a second targeted `addMany` call right after behavioral processing to ensure the new evidence is persisted. Without this, a server restart between cycles would lose all behavioral data. Caught while tracing the cold-start path as part of "olho comportamentos adjacentes".

### Wave 0.5 closure: real session_count in /api/inventory

[src/app/api/inventory/route.ts](src/app/api/inventory/route.ts) — added a per-surface session count query:

```sql
SELECT url, COUNT(DISTINCT "sessionId")::int AS session_count
FROM "RawBehavioralEvent"
WHERE "envId" = $1 AND "occurredAt" >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY url
```

Reuses the same `buildPathMatcher()` 3-tier matcher as `finding_count` (exact path / exact url / substring fallback). Returns `null` only when there are zero events for the env (snippet not installed); returns `0` when snippet IS installed but a particular surface had no traffic — meaningful signal not "missing data".

### Cleanup cron extension

[src/instrumentation-node.ts](src/instrumentation-node.ts) — the existing 1-hour `runLeadCleanup` pass now also prunes `RawBehavioralEvent` rows older than 30 days. The processor re-aggregates the last 30 days every cycle, so older events are dead weight.

### Adjacent flows verified

- **Cold start**: behavioral evidence is persisted via `PrismaEvidenceStore.addMany()`, so `ensureContext()` rebuilds the engine context with behavioral data after a server restart. This is the same path that already worked for HTTP/page evidence.
- **First-time env (no events)**: `processBehavioralEventsForEnv` returns `{ evidence: [], sessionCount: 0 }`. The engine handles the empty case gracefully — no behavioral inferences fire, eligibility gate keeps them dormant.
- **Below 20-session threshold**: events get aggregated, evidence gets emitted, but the engine's `isBehavioralPackEligible()` gates the inferences. The payload still flows through change detection so future cycles can detect "we now have enough sessions".
- **Aggregation fails for one session**: per-session try/catch in the loop means one bad session doesn't poison the batch. Logged as `console.warn`.
- **DB read fails**: outer try/catch returns empty result, audit cycle continues with other evidence.
- **DB write fails on processedAt update**: non-fatal; the next cycle re-aggregates the same window anyway.
- **Surface matcher**: same 3-tier path matcher used for findings, so `/checkout` matches inventory item `/en/checkout/step-2`. Verified via existing Wave 0.7 flow.
- **30-day prune**: events older than 30 days deleted via cron, cascade-protected by `Environment` FK so deleting an env wipes its events too.

### Files touched

- [apps/audit-runner/process-behavioral.ts](apps/audit-runner/process-behavioral.ts) — **new** worker + reducer
- [apps/audit-runner/run-cycle.ts](apps/audit-runner/run-cycle.ts) — wire processor inline before recompute, persist behavioral evidence
- [src/app/api/inventory/route.ts](src/app/api/inventory/route.ts) — real `session_count` from raw events
- [src/instrumentation-node.ts](src/instrumentation-node.ts) — 30-day prune for `RawBehavioralEvent`
- [tests/process-behavioral.test.ts](tests/process-behavioral.test.ts) — **new** 10 reducer tests

### Manual verification

1. Confirm the snippet on a test site is loading and emitting (Wave 0.2)
2. Trigger an audit cycle (or wait for the next scheduled one)
3. Watch logs for `[audit-runner ...] behavioral evidence added (sessions=N, events=M)`
4. Open `/app/inventory` — the `Sessions` column should now show real numbers per row (or 0 for surfaces with no traffic)
5. Open `/app/workspaces` — if `session_count >= 20`, the 7 behavioral workspaces should become non-empty (assuming the workspaces are wired in `recompute.ts` — see below)

### Wave 0 status

| Wave | Status |
|---|---|
| 0.1 | ✅ |
| 0.2 | ✅ |
| **0.3** | ✅ **just shipped** |
| 0.4 | ✅ |
| **0.5** | ✅ **closed by 0.3 + 0.7** |
| 0.6 | ✅ |
| 0.7 | ✅ |

**Wave 0 is now fully complete.** The 7 behavioral workspaces plan at `~/.claude/plans/ticklish-discovering-nova.md` is unblocked and can ship as soon as we want.

## Wave 0.2 -- 2026-04-07 -- Pixel Ingest Endpoint

### Goal

The first-party snippet at [public/snippet/vestigio.js](public/snippet/vestigio.js) has been live for months but its `POST /api/behavioral/ingest` target didn't exist. Every behavioral event sent from a customer site was hitting a 404 and being silently dropped on the snippet's `.catch(() => {})`. Wave 0.2 makes the endpoint real so events actually persist. Wave 0.3 will then read them back and feed `aggregateSession()` so the 7 behavioral workspaces can finally activate.

### Design decisions

**One row per event, not per batch.** The Wave 0.3 worker consumes via `aggregateSession(batch)` from [packages/behavioral/session-aggregator.ts](packages/behavioral/session-aggregator.ts), which takes a `RawBehavioralBatch` (events array) per session. The cleanest reconstruction path is `WHERE envId=? AND sessionId=? AND processedAt IS NULL`. One row per event also gives us:

- Cheap retention pruning by `receivedAt`
- Per-event filtering for debugging
- Idempotent batch inserts via `createMany({ skipDuplicates: true })`

The downside (more rows) is acceptable: even a busy customer at 100 events/session × 10k sessions/day = 1M rows/day is well within Postgres throughput, and Wave 0.3's worker will mark `processedAt` as it consumes them so the active working set stays small.

**Silent 204 always.** A useful 4xx response would teach bots which inputs the validator rejects. The route returns 204 No Content for both successful writes and silent drops, so the only thing observable from outside is "request accepted". Internal `console.warn` for DB failures means we still have visibility.

**Daily-rotating IP hash, not raw IP.** `sha256(ip + day + LEAD_FORM_SECRET)` means the same visitor on the same NAT yields a different hash tomorrow. This prevents the table from being a long-term tracking record while still allowing same-day rate limiting. Raw IPs never persist.

**In-memory rate limiter, not DB-backed.** Rate limiting protects against cost (compute + DB writes), not against precise abuse correlation. A per-process in-memory `Map<ipHash, bucket>` is faster, requires no extra round trip, and the daily prune via the existing instrumentation cron keeps it bounded. The downside (per-process state) is fine because we run on a single Railway instance for now.

### Schema

[prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma) — new `RawBehavioralEvent` model:

```prisma

  envId       String                                  // matches Environment.id (data-env attribute)

Back-relation added on `Environment.behavioralEvents`.

### Defense layers

[src/libs/behavioral-ingest.ts](src/libs/behavioral-ingest.ts) — utility module so the route stays focused on the happy path:

- `KNOWN_EVENT_TYPES` — set of all 28 event types the snippet currently emits, used to drop unknown types silently. Older / newer snippet versions coexist without 4xx noise
- `MAX_EVENT_BYTES = 8 KB` per event payload (the snippet is well below this; cap exists to bound table growth against bugs / hostile clients)
- `MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 100` events per request (snippet flushes at 50; we accept double that for in-flight retries)
- `RATE_LIMIT_EVENTS_PER_MINUTE = 600` per IP (generous — a real user spamming a SPA can't realistically hit this)
- `hashClientIp()` — daily-rotating SHA-256
- `extractClientIp()` — handles `x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip`, `cf-connecting-ip`
- `isKnownEnvironment()` — Prisma `findUnique` with positive cache TTL of 5min and negative cache TTL of 1min (so a freshly-created env doesn't get blocked too long); on Prisma failure returns `true` so a DB hiccup doesn't black-hole legitimate traffic
- `isWithinRateLimit()` — fixed-window 1-minute bucket per IP hash
- `pruneRateBuckets()` — exposed for the instrumentation cron
- `sanitizeEvent()` — drops events with unknown types, non-numeric timestamps, clock skew >24h, or oversized payloads. Re-serializes the event to drop unknown top-level keys and bound size

### The route

[src/app/api/behavioral/ingest/route.ts](src/app/api/behavioral/ingest/route.ts) — `runtime: 'nodejs'`. Three handlers:

- `OPTIONS` — CORS preflight with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (the snippet runs on customer origins)
- `POST` — the ingest path, wrapped in `withErrorTracking` so any throws still show up in our error tracker
- `parseBody()` helper — calls `req.text()` + `JSON.parse` instead of `req.json()` so we transparently accept both `text/plain;charset=UTF-8` (sendBeacon, used on page unload — sendBeacon **forces** that content-type and you can't override it) and `application/json` (the snippet's normal fetch flush path). Both bodies contain JSON

POST flow (all silent drops use `silentOk()`):

1. Parse body → silent drop on bad JSON
2. Validate batch shape (`env_id`, `session_id`, `events[]`) → silent drop
3. Truncate at `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` rather than reject (snippet may legitimately send a backlog after reconnect)
4. `isKnownEnvironment(envId)` → silent drop on unknown env
5. Extract IP → hash → rate-limit check → silent drop on overage
6. Sanitize each event → drop the bad ones, keep the good ones → silent drop if zero remain
7. Build rows: denormalize `attribution` only on the first row of the batch (Wave 0.3's loader uses first-touch semantics)
8. `prisma.rawBehavioralEvent.createMany({ data: rows, skipDuplicates: true })` → on failure, log internally but still return silent OK
9. Return 204 with CORS headers

### Adjacent flows verified

- **Snippet sendBeacon path**: The snippet calls `navigator.sendBeacon(ENDPOINT, payload)` on page unload. This sends `Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8` (forced by the browser, no override). The route's `req.text() + JSON.parse` works regardless of header. Tested by reading the snippet at [public/snippet/vestigio.js:807](public/snippet/vestigio.js#L807).
- **Snippet fetch path**: Normal flush uses `fetch(ENDPOINT, { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, keepalive: true })`. This triggers a CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) because of the custom Content-Type header. The new `OPTIONS` handler returns 204 with the necessary headers.
- **Cross-origin from customer site**: The snippet is loaded with `<script src="https://app.vestigio.io/snippet/vestigio.js" data-env="...">` on customer.com. CORS headers (`Allow-Origin: *`) make the cross-origin POST work. No credentials are sent (snippet doesn't include them).
- **Rate-limit memory leak**: New 5-min cron in [src/instrumentation-node.ts](src/instrumentation-node.ts) calls `pruneRateBuckets()`. Leak bounded.
- **Env-id cache invalidation**: 5-min positive TTL means a deleted environment keeps accepting events for up to 5min. Acceptable — Wave 0.3 will simply skip events whose env no longer resolves.
- **DB write failure**: Wrapped in try/catch with `console.warn`. The snippet has `.catch(() => {})` so the user experience is unaffected. Wave 0.3 will retry naturally because failed writes never set `processedAt`.

### Files touched

- [prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma) — new `RawBehavioralEvent` model + `Environment.behavioralEvents` back-relation
- [src/libs/behavioral-ingest.ts](src/libs/behavioral-ingest.ts) — **new** defense / hygiene helpers
- [src/app/api/behavioral/ingest/route.ts](src/app/api/behavioral/ingest/route.ts) — **new** POST + OPTIONS handlers
- [src/instrumentation-node.ts](src/instrumentation-node.ts) — wired `pruneRateBuckets` into the existing cron registry

### Manual configuration step

The Prisma model is in source control but the table doesn't exist in production yet. Run once (same pattern as Wave 0.7):

```bash
DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL npx prisma db push
```

The Next.js build is fine without the table — Prisma client generation succeeds because the model is in the schema. But the first POST that reaches the live route will fail with `relation "RawBehavioralEvent" does not exist` (logged internally, silent 204 to caller) until the table is created.

### Manual verification

1. Push the schema (above)
2. Confirm the snippet on a test site is configured with `data-env="<real-environment-id>"` (the data-sources page generates the snippet template)
3. Visit a page on the test site, click around, scroll, navigate
4. Open browser DevTools → Network → filter `behavioral/ingest` — should show 204 responses
5. Query the table: `SELECT envId, sessionId, eventType, occurredAt FROM "RawBehavioralEvent" ORDER BY "receivedAt" DESC LIMIT 50;` — should show real events
6. Wave 0.3 (next) will pick these up via `aggregateSession` and produce `BehavioralSessionPayload` evidence

### What this unlocks

- **Wave 0.3** can immediately start consuming the persisted events
- **Wave 0.5** flips from "partial" to "fully complete" once 0.3 ships (sessions column will have real values)
- **The 7 behavioral workspaces plan** at `~/.claude/plans/ticklish-discovering-nova.md` becomes eligible to ship — they require ≥20 sessions of pixel data, and now there's a path for that data to exist

## Wave 0.6 -- 2026-04-07 -- Verification Frontend Wiring

### Goal

The Actions drawer's `VerificationPanel` already had a "Re-verify" CTA and a post-resolution "Confirm Resolution" CTA, but both were `onRequestVerification={() => toast.success(...)}` toast-only stubs. Wire them to the real MCP verification orchestrator that already exists end-to-end (verify → policy gate → orchestrator → recompute → projections refresh) so the buttons actually do something. No new engine code — purely connecting an existing pipeline to its UI surface.

### Key insight from investigation

Almost everything was already in place:

- `McpServer.verify()` already routes through the global verification policy, the orchestrator, evidence-store rehydration, and an `assembleContext()` recompute on success
- The orchestrator's `executeAndRecompute()` returns updated evidence + recomputation result
- The projection layer already maps `verification_maturity` from decision lifecycle state, so as soon as the engine context is rebuilt, `loadActions()` returns fresh maturity for the same action_key

The only missing pieces were:

1. A POST API route that bridges browser → MCP singleton (the singleton is server-only)
2. The actions page replacing its toast stubs with a real `fetch()` + `router.refresh()`
3. A latent bug fix: `McpServer.executeVerification()` was rebuilding the engine context **without** translations or `previousSnapshot`, so every verification erased i18n labels and `change_class` info from the post-verify projections

### What changed

**MCP server — preserve translations + previousSnapshot across recomputes** ([apps/mcp/server.ts](apps/mcp/server.ts))

`McpServer.loadContext()` now caches the optional `translations` and `previousSnapshot` arguments on the instance. `executeVerification()` passes them through when it rebuilds the engine context after a verification result lands. Before this fix, clicking "Re-verify" would silently drop change_class badges and revert root-cause titles to English (or to internal keys when no translations were provided). Pre-existing latent bug — caught while tracing the verify pipeline as part of "olho comportamentos adjacentes".

**New API route** ([src/app/api/verification/run/route.ts](src/app/api/verification/run/route.ts))

`POST /api/verification/run` — `runtime: 'nodejs'`, `maxDuration: 60`. Body: `{ action_id: string, intent?: 're_verify' | 'confirm_resolution' }`. Flow:

1. `isAuthorized()` → org → environment → website (mirrors `/api/inventory`)
2. `loadEngineTranslations()` for the cookie locale + `ensureContext()` to bootstrap the MCP singleton if cold-started
3. Look up the `GlobalAction` by `action_key` in `mcpServer.getContext().result.intelligence.global_actions` — returns 404 if the action no longer exists (e.g., the user re-ran the audit in another tab)
4. Derive `decision_ref` from `action.source_decisions[0]`, `subject_ref` from `website:${website.domain}`, and a human-readable `reason` like `"Manual re-verification requested for: <action.title>"`
5. `await mcpServer.verify({ verification_type: 'browser_verification', subject_ref, reason, decision_ref, requested_by: 'manual' })` — the global policy may downgrade the requested type
6. After completion, call `get_action_projections` and return the **single updated action projection** alongside the verification status, so the client can refresh its drawer without an extra round trip

Three response shapes:

- `{ ok: true, skipped: false, verification, action }` — completed (or downgraded by policy and ran)
- `{ ok: true, skipped: true, recommended_type, reasoning, alternatives }` — policy fully denied. Surfaced as an info toast with the policy's reasoning, not an error
- `{ ok: false, code, message }` — actual failure (auth, no context, action not found, orchestrator threw)

**Actions page wiring** ([src/app/(console)/actions/page.tsx](src/app/(console)/actions/page.tsx))

- New `verifyingId` state in `ActionsContent` (one verification at a time per page)
- New `runVerification(action, intent)` async handler: pending toast → POST → success/info/error toast → `router.refresh()` to re-fetch projections through the layout
- `ActionDrawerContent` now accepts `onRunVerification` and `isVerifying` props
- The two `VerificationPanel` callbacks (`onRequestVerification`, `onConfirmResolution`) now call `onRunVerification(intent)` with the right intent string instead of toast-only stubs
- The bottom "Run Verification" resolve button (visible when `resolve_path === 'verify'`) is also wired to the same handler. The other resolve paths (`fix`, `track`, `dismiss`) remain placeholders awaiting their own pipelines — explicit comment in the code so future readers don't think it's a bug
- New i18n keys: `verificationRunning`, `verificationFailed`, `verificationSkipped` added to en/pt-BR/es dictionaries

### Adjacent flows verified

- **Cold start**: After a server restart, `ensureContext()` rebuilds the MCP context from the latest persisted cycle (Wave 0.7) before the verify route runs. Tested by reading the console-data ensureContext path.
- **Translations after verify**: With the latent bug fix above, post-verify projections now keep the user's locale labels.
- **Change_class after verify**: With the same fix, the previous snapshot from Wave 0.7 still drives change classification on the recomputed result.
- **Multiple verifications in sequence**: `verifyingId` state guards against double-clicks. The orchestrator's `active_count` policy is decremented on completion in `mcpServer.verify()` so subsequent calls aren't blocked.
- **Action disappears mid-verify**: If the user re-runs the audit while a verification is in flight, the new audit produces a different `action_key` set; on completion the `get_action_projections` lookup may return undefined for the original id. The route still returns `ok: true` with `action: null` so the client doesn't crash.
- **Singleton scope**: The verification result lives only in the in-memory MCP singleton on the process that handled the request. In multi-process production deployments, other processes won't see the new evidence until they hit DB-backed data again. Tracked as known limitation — full cross-process verification persistence is a separate concern.

### Files touched

- [apps/mcp/server.ts](apps/mcp/server.ts) — cache `translations` + `previousSnapshot`, pass through on verify-recompute
- [src/app/api/verification/run/route.ts](src/app/api/verification/run/route.ts) — **new** POST route
- [src/app/(console)/actions/page.tsx](src/app/(console)/actions/page.tsx) — replace toast stubs with real handler, add spinner state
- [dictionary/en.json](dictionary/en.json), [dictionary/pt-BR.json](dictionary/pt-BR.json), [dictionary/es.json](dictionary/es.json) — `verificationRunning` / `verificationFailed` / `verificationSkipped` keys

### Manual verification

1. Run an audit on any environment so the actions table populates
2. Open `/app/actions`, click any action with `resolve_path === "verify"`
3. Click "Re-verify" inside the drawer's verification panel — should show a "Running verification…" toast, then either success or a policy-skipped info toast (with reasoning)
4. After success, the drawer should reflect the updated maturity without a manual refresh
5. Verify in browser devtools that `POST /api/verification/run` returned `200 { ok: true }` and that the response body's `action.verification_maturity` matches what's now shown in the table

### Known follow-ups

- Verifications don't persist across server restarts (in-memory only). Adding a `VerificationResult` Prisma model + `loadOnBootstrap()` is a future task
- The "fix" / "track" / "dismiss" resolve paths are still stubs awaiting their own backend pipelines

## Wave 0.7 -- 2026-04-07 -- Findings Persistence + Change Detection

### Goal

Close the last load-bearing pipeline gap from the audit: findings live only in the MCP server's in-memory singleton, change detection never runs (because nobody persists previous-cycle snapshots), and `/api/inventory` returns `finding_count: null` because there's no DB-backed source. Make finding persistence a default platform capability so:

1. Server restart doesn't lose findings (no expensive recompute on every cold start)
2. Running an audit twice on the same env shows real `change_class` (regression / improvement / new_issue / resolved / stable_risk) on each finding
3. `/api/inventory` shows real `finding_count` per surface
4. The frontend `change_class` badges in `/app/(console)/analysis/page.tsx` (already wired to filter + render) light up with real data without any UI work

### Key insight from investigation

Almost all of the change detection plumbing already existed:
- `recomputeAll()` already accepts `previous_snapshot` as input AND already produces `current_snapshot: VersionedSnapshot` as output
- `detectChanges()` is pure — just compares two snapshots
- `SnapshotStore` interface + `InMemorySnapshotStore` reference impl already exist in `packages/change-detection/snapshot-store.ts`
- `FindingProjection.change_class` field already exists, frontend already filters/renders it
- The frontend `/app/(console)/analysis/page.tsx` already has change_class filters and `<ChangeBadge>` rendering wired

The only missing pieces were: (a) a persistent SnapshotStore, (b) a FindingStore, (c) wiring the lookup→recompute→save loop into the audit-runner and the legacy stream route, and (d) a real source for `/api/inventory` finding_count.

### What changed

**Two new Prisma models pushed to production**

- `CycleSnapshot` ([prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma)) — one row per `recomputeAll()` call. Stores JSON-serialized `decisions[]` + `signals[]` + metadata (decision_count, signal_count, audit_mode, recompute_ms, content_hash, isBaseline). FK to `AuditCycle` when known. Indexed by `(workspaceRef, environmentRef, createdAt)` for fast latest-snapshot lookups. Retention: keep latest 10 per env (matches `DEFAULT_RETENTION_COUNT`), pruned by audit-runner at the end of each cycle.

- `Finding` ([prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma)) — one row per `FindingProjection` produced by `projectAll()`. Stores denormalized columns for fast queries (`environmentId`, `surface`, `pack`, `severity`, `polarity`, `inferenceKey`, `changeClass`, `verificationMaturity`, `impactMin/Max/Midpoint`) plus the full projection JSON in a `projection` text column for cheap rehydration on cold start. Unique `(cycleId, inferenceKey)` constraint so re-running the same cycle upserts cleanly. Indexed by `(environmentId, cycleId)`, `(environmentId, surface)`, `(environmentId, severity)`, `(cycleRef, inferenceKey)`. Cascading delete from `AuditCycle`.

Back-relations added on `AuditCycle.findings[]`, `AuditCycle.snapshots[]`, `Environment.findings[]`.

**Two new stores**

- [packages/change-detection/prisma-snapshot-store.ts](packages/change-detection/prisma-snapshot-store.ts) — `PrismaSnapshotStore` implements the `SnapshotStore` interface from `snapshot-store.ts`. The legacy interface is sync (in-memory contract), so each method has both a sync version (fire-and-forget) and an `asyncXxx` variant for callers that need to await durability. The audit-runner always uses async variants. Includes `asyncSave`, `asyncGetLatest`, `asyncGetById`, `asyncGetBaseline`, `asyncSetBaseline` (with transactional baseline-clear), `asyncGetNthRecent`, `asyncList`, `asyncPrune` (preserves baselines). Exported from `packages/change-detection/index.ts`.

- [packages/projections/prisma-finding-store.ts](packages/projections/prisma-finding-store.ts) — `PrismaFindingStore` with three main methods: `saveForCycle({cycleId, environmentId, cycleRef, findings})` upserts findings by `(cycleId, inferenceKey)` so re-runs don't leave dangling rows; `loadLatestForEnvironment(environmentId)` returns the most recent cycle's findings for cold-start rehydration; `countBySurfaceForLatestCycle(environmentId)` returns a `Map<surface, count>` filtered to negative + neutral polarity findings only (positives are reinforcement messages, not problems). Also `pruneOlderThan(environmentId, keepCount)`. Exported from `packages/projections/index.ts`.

**Audit-runner wiring** ([apps/audit-runner/run-cycle.ts](apps/audit-runner/run-cycle.ts))

The worker now runs the full engine + persistence chain after the existing evidence + PageInventoryItem persistence. Order:

1. Load previous snapshot via `snapshotStore.asyncGetLatest(workspaceRef, environmentRef)` — returns null cleanly on first cycle
2. Load `BusinessProfile` for the org so the engine sees real `businessModel` + `conversionModel` priors
3. Load engine translations for i18n
4. Call `recomputeAll({...input, previous_snapshot, translations, business_inputs})` — engine produces `change_report` when previous exists
5. `projectAll(multiPackResult, translations)` → FindingProjections with populated `change_class`
6. `snapshotStore.asyncSave(multiPackResult.current_snapshot, cycleId)` (awaited so the prune in step 9 sees it)
7. `findingStore.saveForCycle({cycleId, environmentId, cycleRef, findings})` (awaited)
8. `snapshotStore.asyncPrune(workspaceRef, environmentRef)` (best-effort)
9. Mark cycle complete

Per-step failures are caught individually in a non-fatal try/catch so a single store hiccup can't fail the whole audit (evidence + inventory are already in DB by the time we get here, those are still useful even if findings persist breaks).

**Stream route wiring** ([src/app/api/analysis/stream/route.ts](src/app/api/analysis/stream/route.ts))

The legacy "manual run analysis" SSE route now also looks up + saves snapshots via `PrismaSnapshotStore`. It does NOT persist findings because it doesn't create a real `AuditCycle` row (uses synthetic `audit_cycle:live_${ts}` ref that has no FK target). Snapshot save is fire-and-forget. Findings consumed by the stream itself are still computed in-memory and emitted via SSE — that part works as before.

**MCP context propagation** ([apps/mcp/context.ts](apps/mcp/context.ts), [apps/mcp/server.ts](apps/mcp/server.ts), [apps/mcp/bootstrap.ts](apps/mcp/bootstrap.ts))

Added optional `previousSnapshot?: CycleSnapshot | null` parameter to `assembleContext()`, `loadContext()`, and `bootstrapMcpContextSync()`. Defaults to undefined so all existing test callers stay compatible. When provided, the engine emits `change_report` and the resulting `FindingProjection.change_class` gets the real classification on cold-start rehydration too.

**Cold start optimization** ([src/lib/console-data.ts](src/lib/console-data.ts))

`ensureContext()` now also pre-loads the previous snapshot from `PrismaSnapshotStore` and passes it through to `bootstrapMcpContextSync()`. So when a user visits `/app/analysis` after a server restart, the rehydrated MCP context has change_class populated without needing a fresh recompute pass.

**`/api/inventory` real finding counts** ([src/app/api/inventory/route.ts](src/app/api/inventory/route.ts))

Replaced the Wave 0.5 `null` placeholder. The route now calls `findingStore.countBySurfaceForLatestCycle(environmentId)` and returns a `Map<surface, count>`. A new `buildPathMatcher()` helper joins finding surfaces (e.g. `/checkout`) to inventory items (e.g. `/en/checkout/step-2`) via a 3-tier match: exact path equality, exact normalizedUrl equality, then substring fallback. Surface `/` only counts toward the landing item, not every page. `finding_count` returns:
- A real count (could be `0`) when an audit has completed for the env
- `null` only when NO audit has ever completed (so the UI hides the column for fresh accounts, not for accounts where audits ran but had 0 findings)

`hasFindingData` is true if either `surfaceCounts.size > 0` OR the latest cycle is `complete` with `completedAt !== null`.

### Adjacent flow verification

- **Lead promotion** ([apps/audit-runner/promote-lead.ts](apps/audit-runner/promote-lead.ts)) — calls `runAuditCycle()` at step 7 of `promoteLeadToOrg()`. Auto-inherits the new behavior with zero changes. ✅
- **Admin prospect scans** ([apps/audit-runner/run-prospect-scan.ts](apps/audit-runner/run-prospect-scan.ts)) — uses `deriveMiniAuditFindings()` (static heuristics, not the engine). Correctly skips Finding row persistence — these are outreach assets, not real customer audits. ✅
- **Frontend filters** ([src/app/(console)/analysis/page.tsx](src/app/(console)/analysis/page.tsx#L323)) — already had `change_class` dropdown filters, `<ChangeBadge>` row rendering, and finding-detail badge display. They now light up automatically with no UI changes needed. ✅

### What's still null in /api/inventory

- `session_count` — still null until Wave 0.2 + 0.3 (pixel ingest + worker) ship. Surfaces show no Sessions column when 100% null, which is correct behavior.

## Sprint 2-4 -- 2026-04-07 -- Dual Funnel: /lp Lead Funnel + Admin Surface Scans

### Goal

Build the second commercial funnel discussed with the sales team: an anonymous lead funnel at `/lp` that lets visitors run a free mini-audit on their domain, see ~5 findings, and pay via Paddle without ever signing up first. Pair it with an admin tool ("Surface Scans") for outbound prospect audits with shareable result links. Both reuse the existing crawler pipeline via a new mode system.

### What changed

**Sprint 2 — Pipeline modes refactor**

[workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts](workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts) now accepts `mode: 'full' | 'shallow_plus' | 'shallow'` on `StagedPipelineInput`. Default is `full` (existing behavior, all callers unchanged). New modes:
- `shallow_plus` — Stage A + truncated C, ~6 fetches, 15s budget. Used by admin Surface Scans.
- `shallow` — Stage A only, 1 fetch, 5s budget. Used by /lp/audit anonymous mini-audit.

`MODE_CONSTRAINTS` preset is layered with `DEFAULT_CONSTRAINTS` and the caller's explicit `crawl_constraints` (caller wins). All three modes share the same parser, evidence shape, and `coverage_entries` — only stage gating + crawl constraints differ.

Two helper modules added:
- [workers/ingestion/landing-preview.ts](workers/ingestion/landing-preview.ts) — `extractLandingPreview()` pulls title, meta description, og:image, favicon (with `/favicon.ico` convention fallback), h1, response time from a Stage A homepage fetch. Returns a JSON-serializable `LandingPreview` for the result page.
- [workers/ingestion/mini-audit-findings.ts](workers/ingestion/mini-audit-findings.ts) — `deriveMiniAuditFindings()` always returns 5 visible findings + 10 blurred placeholders. Five heuristic detectors (no SEO per product brief): trust signal gap, multiple primary CTAs competing, vague CTA copy, form friction overload, CTA below the fold. Less than 5 negatives → fallback positives. Less than 5 total → padding finding. Sort by severity (critical → positive). Confidence intentionally not exposed.

**Sprint 3 — /lp anonymous lead funnel end-to-end**

Two new Prisma models pushed to production via `prisma db push`:
- `AnonymousLead` — one row per /lp/audit visitor that starts the form. Tracks email, domain, business model, monthly revenue, ticket, conversion model, phone. Lifecycle: `draft → auditing → audit_complete → checkout_started → converted → expired/spam`. Carries anti-abuse signals (ipAddress, userAgent, formStartedAt, behavioralScore, honeypotTripped). Indexed for cleanup cron + IP rate limiting.
- `MiniAuditResult` — cached mini-audit per domain (14d TTL). Keyed by `sha256(normalized_domain)`. Multiple leads on the same domain reuse the cached crawl + findings — kills the cost of spam at known domains.

Shared form fields ([src/components/form-fields/](src/components/form-fields/)) — single source of truth for fields used by both `/onboard` and `/lp/audit`:
- `types.ts` — `BUSINESS_TYPE_OPTIONS`, `CONVERSION_MODEL_OPTIONS`, `parseRevenue()`, `isValidPhone()`, `isValidDomainFormat()`
- `StyledDropdown.tsx` — custom dropdown replacing the platform `<select>` (per brief: "use our styled dropdown, not system")
- `SharedFields.tsx` — `DomainField` (input + ownership checkbox bundle), `TextField`, `BusinessTypeField`, `ConversionModelField`, `RevenueField`, `AverageTicketField`, `PhoneField`, `EmailField`, `OwnershipCheckbox`

Anti-bot defense stack ([src/libs/lead-defense.ts](src/libs/lead-defense.ts)) — five layers, **zero captchas** (per brief: must not kill the funnel):
1. Cryptographic form session token (HMAC-SHA256, 30min TTL, constant-time verify)
2. JS-only header check (`X-Vestigio-Form-Session`)
3. Honeypot field (`<input name="website" hidden>`) — tripped → silent spam + fake 200
4. Time-on-form check (min 8s dwell)
5. Behavioral score (0-100) computed from frontend-reported event counts (mousemove, keydown, focus, scroll). <30 → reject

Input validation ([src/libs/lead-validation.ts](src/libs/lead-validation.ts)) — rejects test/teste/johndoe local parts, example.com domains, 30 disposable email providers, all-same-digit / sequential phone numbers, $500-$5M/mo realistic revenue range, IP addresses / localhost / vestigio.io self-audit / top-100 site blocklist (FAANG, Brazilian incumbents, test domains).

Pages built:
- [src/app/(site)/lp/page.tsx](src/app/(site)/lp/page.tsx) + [src/components/HomeLp/](src/components/HomeLp/) — landing page variant. Reuses Hero/CallToAction/MiniCalculator from main Home with new optional `primaryCtaHref`/`primaryCtaLabel` props. Default unchanged. `noindex` so it doesn't compete with `/` in search.
- [src/app/(site)/lp/audit/page.tsx](src/app/(site)/lp/audit/page.tsx) — 4-step form using shared field components. Step indicator, error display, navigation. Honeypot, behavioral counters, form token, JS-only header all wired.
- [src/app/(site)/lp/audit/result/[leadId]/page.tsx](src/app/(site)/lp/audit/result/[leadId]/page.tsx) — animated reveal of preview card + 5 visible findings (stagger 200ms) + 10 blurred grid + Paddle Checkout CTA. Polls `/api/lead/[id]` every 3s while audit in progress. Three render branches: AuditingState (6-stage progress flicker), LoadingState, ErrorState. Share button copies URL to clipboard.
- [src/app/(site)/lp/audit/result/[leadId]/opengraph-image.tsx](src/app/(site)/lp/audit/result/[leadId]/opengraph-image.tsx) — edge runtime, 1200x630 PNG. Fetches lead data, composes a dark zinc share preview with domain + finding count + headline finding. Cached 60s.
- [src/app/(site)/lp/audit/thank-you/[leadId]/page.tsx](src/app/(site)/lp/audit/thank-you/[leadId]/page.tsx) — post-checkout bridge. Polls until `lead.status === 'converted'`, shows masked email, "Setting up your workspace…" → "Workspace ready · magic link sent". 90s slow-path message offering support.

API routes (new):
- `POST /api/lead/start` — creates `AnonymousLead{status:'draft'}`, issues HMAC token, per-IP rate limit (5/hour) reading from the lead table directly (no Redis dep)
- `PATCH /api/lead/[id]/step/[n]` — runs `evaluateDefenses()` + per-step validation. Honeypot tripped → silent spam + fake 200
- `POST /api/lead/[id]/run-audit` — fire-and-forget the worker, idempotent
- `GET /api/lead/[id]` — public read for polling + OG image. Email is masked

Workers (new):
- [apps/audit-runner/run-mini-audit.ts](apps/audit-runner/run-mini-audit.ts) — `runMiniAudit(leadId)`. Cache lookup by `sha256(domain)`, cache hit → reuse, cache miss → direct fetch + parse + shallow pipeline + persist `MiniAuditResult`. Failure rolls lead status back to `draft` so user can retry.
- [apps/audit-runner/promote-lead.ts](apps/audit-runner/promote-lead.ts) — `promoteLeadToOrg(leadId, plan, customerId)`. Called from Paddle webhook on `transaction.completed` when `custom_data.leadId` is present. Resolves/creates User by email (reuses existing on collision per product policy), creates Org+Membership+Environment+BusinessProfile+AuditCycle, persists phone+notification prefs, mints NextAuth-compatible magic link token (`sha256(token+SECRET)`), sends via Brevo, marks `status='converted'`, fire-and-forget `runAuditCycle()` for the real audit. Idempotent.

Paddle webhook ([src/app/api/paddle/webhook/route.ts](src/app/api/paddle/webhook/route.ts)) — `handleOnboardingActivation()` now forks based on `custom_data`:
- `{ organizationId, userId, onboarding: 'true' }` → existing /onboard activation path (unchanged)
- `{ leadId, lpFunnel: 'true' }` → calls `promoteLeadToOrg()`

Both `subscription.created` and `transaction.completed` events forward `leadId` and now also pass `customer_id` through to be persisted on the User row.

Cleanup cron ([src/instrumentation-node.ts](src/instrumentation-node.ts)) — extended with a 1h interval:
- Deletes `AnonymousLead` where `expiresAt < now AND status != 'converted'`
- Purges `MiniAuditResult` where `expiresAt` is more than 7d in the past (cache TTL is 14d, +7d grace for admin inspection)

**Sprint 4 — Admin Surface Scans (Growth → Surface Scans tab)**

New Prisma model `ProspectScan` pushed to production:
- One row per admin-initiated outbound scan
- `shareToken` is 32-char random hex (128 bits entropy) used in the public `/scans/[token]` URL
- Tracks domain, label, internal notes, status (pending/running/complete/failed), pagesScanned, durationMs, errorMsg, createdByUserId
- `preview`, `visibleFindings`, `blurredFindings` stored as JSON blobs

New worker [apps/audit-runner/run-prospect-scan.ts](apps/audit-runner/run-prospect-scan.ts) — sister to `run-mini-audit.ts` but uses `mode='shallow_plus'` (deeper crawl: 1 home + 5 critical pages, 15s budget). No cache (admin trusted, no abuse mitigation needed). Persists everything to `ProspectScan`. Heal helper `healStuckProspectScans()` fails scans stuck >10min in `running`.

Admin APIs:
- `GET /api/admin/surface-scans` → list with optional `?search` and `?status` filters, summary counts
- `POST /api/admin/surface-scans` → creates scan, dispatches worker fire-and-forget. Goes through `validateLeadDomain()` (same blocklist as /lp)
- `GET /api/admin/surface-scans/[id]` → full scan detail (used by polling + row expander)
- `DELETE /api/admin/surface-scans/[id]` → permanent delete

Public scan API + page:
- `GET /api/scans/[token]` → public, no auth. Returns scan data (no internal notes, no createdBy). Failed scans return 410. Token must be exactly 32 chars
- [src/app/(site)/scans/[token]/page.tsx](src/app/(site)/scans/[token]/page.tsx) — public shareable result page. Same visual treatment as `/lp/audit/result/[leadId]` but **no** "Unlock" CTA — instead has a soft "Want this for your own site? → /lp/audit" outreach CTA. Goal: visitor sees their site, gets curious, runs their own free audit

Admin page ([src/app/app/admin/surface-scans/page.tsx](src/app/app/admin/surface-scans/page.tsx)) modeled on the Organizations admin page:
- Stat cards (total, in progress, complete, failed)
- Status filter chips (all/pending/running/complete/failed)
- Searchable list with expandable rows
- Click a row → expands inline with preview card + 5 findings + share link
- "+ New scan" button opens a modal (domain + label + internal notes)
- "Copy link" button per row (when complete) with feedback toast
- Polls every 5s while any row is pending/running

Sidebar nav ([src/components/app/sidebar-nav-data.ts](src/components/app/sidebar-nav-data.ts)) — added `surface_scans` as third child of `admin-growth` (between marketing and newsletters).

**Bonus fix — admin "Settings" inalcançável**: The admin sidebar `admin-settings` group only had `admin-users` + `admin-config`. There was no link to `/app/settings` (where the language selector lives), so an admin browsing `/app/admin` couldn't change their language without typing the URL or using the top-bar org dropdown. Added `admin-account-settings` item under the same group pointing to `/app/settings`. New i18n key `account_settings` added to all 4 dictionaries (en, pt-BR, es, de) along with `surface_scans`.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_LP_PRICE_ID=<your $99/mo Vestigio price ID>
LEAD_FORM_SECRET=<openssl rand -hex 32>     # optional, falls back to SECRET
```

If `NEXT_PUBLIC_PADDLE_LP_PRICE_ID` isn't set, the "Unlock the full audit" CTA on the result page shows "Pricing isn't configured yet" instead of opening checkout.

## Sprint 1 -- 2026-04-07 -- Onboarding → Auto-Audit → Live Inventory (Wave 0.1, 0.4, 0.5 partial)

### Goal

Close the load-bearing gap surfaced by the 2026-04-06 audit: a paying user finishes checkout and **nothing happens**. The `AuditCycle pending` row was orphaned (no consumer), `PageInventoryItem` was only ever written by `prisma/seed.ts`, and `/api/inventory` returned hardcoded `MOCK_*` numbers. Goal of Sprint 1 is the "wow effect" first session: payment → live inventory page where rows appear in real time as the crawler discovers them.

### What changed

**New worker:** [apps/audit-runner/run-cycle.ts](apps/audit-runner/run-cycle.ts) exports `runAuditCycle(cycleId)`. Picks up an `AuditCycle` in `pending`, marks it `running`, calls the existing `runStagedPipeline()` from [workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts](workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts) (no rewrites — that pipeline already worked, it just had no caller), persists Evidence via `PrismaEvidenceStore.addMany()`, then loops `coverage_entries` and upserts `Website` (also previously missing — silent gap that would have made `/api/inventory` return `"No website found"` even after a successful crawl) and one `PageInventoryItem` per discovered URL with `pageType` inferred from path patterns. Marks `complete` on success or `failed` on error. Per-row failures are non-fatal.

**Staged pipeline expose change:** [workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts](workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts) `StagedPipelineResult` now also returns `coverage_entries: CoverageEntry[]` (array form of the internal `coverage` map). The existing SSE stream route ignores it; the new worker uses it for inventory persistence. Zero behavior change for existing callers.

**Webhook wiring:** Both [src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts](src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts) and [src/app/api/paddle/webhook/route.ts](src/app/api/paddle/webhook/route.ts) now do `prisma.auditCycle.create({...pending}) → import('apps/audit-runner/run-cycle').runAuditCycle(cycle.id).catch(logErr)`. Fire-and-forget — webhook returns 200 immediately, the worker keeps running in the Next.js process background. Errors are logged but never crash the webhook handler.

**Heal cron:** [src/instrumentation.ts](src/instrumentation.ts) registers a 60s `setInterval` after Prisma is initialized that calls two helpers from the worker module:
- `healStuckCycles()` — auto-fails cycles stuck in `running` >10 minutes (process crashed mid-crawl)
- `redispatchOrphanedPending()` — re-fires cycles still `pending` >5 minutes (process restarted between webhook and dispatch)

A boot pass also runs immediately on startup, so any orphans from a previous incarnation get healed within seconds.

**`/api/inventory` rewrite:** [src/app/api/inventory/route.ts](src/app/api/inventory/route.ts) drops the `MOCK_SESSION_COUNTS` and `MOCK_FINDING_COUNTS` constants entirely. Both fields now return `null`. The response shape gains an `audit_status: { cycle_id, status, started_at, completed_at } | null` block read from the latest `AuditCycle` for the env, so the UI can show the live banner. Empty inventory + ongoing audit returns `data: []` with the audit_status populated (not the empty state).

**Frontend live banner + polling:** [src/app/(console)/inventory/page.tsx](src/app/(console)/inventory/page.tsx) now polls `loadInventory()` every 3 seconds while `audit_status.status === 'pending' | 'running'`, stops once it goes to `complete` or `failed`. New banner-row sits between the table header and the first data row with a pulsing emerald dot and "Audit in progress — discovering pages live · new pages will appear here automatically". Disappears the moment the cycle completes.

**Mock-free UI:** The same page now hides the `sessions` and `findings` columns entirely when 100% of the rows have `null` values (waiting on Wave 0.2/0.3/0.7). Filter logic, summary cards, and the side drawer are all null-safe. No fake numbers anywhere.

**Ownership confirmation:** [src/app/(console)/onboard/page.tsx](src/app/(console)/onboard/page.tsx) `domain` step now requires a checkbox: "I own this domain or have authorization to audit it." Form can't advance without it. Pre-empts legal/abuse risk before the worker actually crawls.

**Thank-you bridge page:** New [src/app/app/onboarding/thank-you/page.tsx](src/app/app/onboarding/thank-you/page.tsx) shows a 4-stage progress flicker ("Payment confirmed → Spinning up workspace → Queueing first audit → Opening inventory") and auto-redirects to `/app/inventory` after 4 seconds. Manual "skip" link for impatient users. Onboarding now hands off to it after the post-payment session polling instead of going straight to `/app/analysis`.

### What this unlocks

- **Wave 0.1** ✅ Onboarding → Ingestion auto-trigger
- **Wave 0.4** ✅ Inventory auto-build from parser
- **Wave 0.5** ⚠️ Partial — mocks gone, real numbers blocked on 0.2/0.3/0.7

### What's still broken (next up)

- **Wave 0.2 + 0.3** Pixel ingest + worker (sessions still null in inventory)
- **Wave 0.7** Findings persistence (findings still null in inventory, change detection still mocked)
- **Wave 0.6** Verification frontend wiring (drawer button still a `toast.success(...)` stub)

## Pipeline Audit -- 2026-04-06 -- Ground Truth vs Roadmap

### Goal

Walk every step of the user-visible pipeline (1. onboarding → 2. domain registration → 3. audit → 4. parsing/inventory → 5. findings → 6. frontend → 7. workspaces/maps → 8. pixel → 9. verification) and verify what actually works in code versus what the roadmap claims. Use the findings to rebuild [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

### Method

Four parallel exploration agents, each with non-overlapping phases. Every claim was verified against source files (no assumptions): inventory mock counts confirmed at [src/app/api/inventory/route.ts:21-39](src/app/api/inventory/route.ts#L21), pixel endpoint absence confirmed by `find src/app/api -type d` (only `/api/admin/marketing/pixels` exists, no `/api/behavioral/`), verification UI handler confirmed at [src/app/(console)/actions/page.tsx:563](src/app/(console)/actions/page.tsx#L563) (`onRequestVerification={() => toast.success(...)}`), MCP `verify()` chain confirmed working at [apps/mcp/server.ts:217-275](apps/mcp/server.ts#L217).

### Per-phase status

| # | Phase | State | Key file:line | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | Onboarding form + payment + DB seeding | ✅ Works | onboard/page.tsx, paddle/webhook:435 | Org, Environment, BusinessProfile, Membership, AuditCycle all created. Notifications step persists phone + prefs correctly. |
| 2 | First-audit auto-trigger after payment | ❌ Broken | paddle/webhook:435 (creates row), no consumer | AuditCycle row created with `status='pending'` but **nothing reads it**. Pipeline only starts when user manually navigates to `/app/analysis`. |
| 3a | Staged pipeline Stages A/B/C (bootstrap, first value, crawl) | ✅ Works | workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts:174-342 | Coverage tracking, challenge detection, content dedup, SPA detection — all live. |
| 3b | Stage D (selective headless / Playwright resolution) | ❌ Reserved | staged-pipeline.ts:346-348 | Detects SPA patterns, emits warning, then jumps directly to `complete`. |
| 3c | Katana / Nuclei runners | ⚠️ Built, never invoked | workers/katana/runner.ts, workers/nuclei/runner.ts | Subprocess CLI adapters work standalone. No caller in main pipeline. |
| 3d | Browser verification + authenticated journey executors | ✅ Works (on-demand only) | workers/verification/executors.ts | Used by MCP verification path (Phase 9), not by main collection. |
| 3e | `integration_pull` executor (Shopify, GA, etc.) | ❌ Stub | executors.ts:197-212 | Returns "not yet implemented". |
| 4a | HTML parsing → evidence | ✅ Works | workers/ingestion/parser.ts:80-381 | Inline scripts, structured data, policy content all extracted. |
| 4b | Evidence persistence to PostgreSQL | ✅ Works | analysis/stream/route.ts:219, packages/evidence/prisma-store.ts | Survives server restart via `loadLatestCycle()`. |
| 4c | Inventory auto-build (`PageInventoryItem`) | ❌ Broken | api/inventory/route.ts:78 reads only | Table is queried but **only written by `prisma/seed.ts`**. After a real audit, inventory page shows empty (or seed data if you ran the seeder). |
| 4d | `SurfaceRelation` writes | ❌ Missing | schema exists, no writer | Forms/links/iframes parsed but not stored as relations. |
| 4e | Inventory mock counts | ❌ Mock data | api/inventory/route.ts:21-39 | `MOCK_FINDING_COUNTS` (`checkout: 4, cart: 2, ...`) hardcoded. TODO comments admit it's fake. Even after a real audit you see the same numbers. |
| 4f | `body_text_snippet` 500 → 2000 chars | ❌ Not done | parser.ts:105 | ROADMAP 3.2A still pending. Limits semantic enrichment. |
| 5a | Multi-pack `recomputeAll()` | ✅ Works | packages/workspace/recompute.ts:218-717 | All 4 packs (Scale, Revenue, Chargeback, SaaS) + behavioral wired. Truth resolution + suppression + confidence audit all live. |
| 5b | Findings projection | ✅ Works | packages/projections/engine.ts | **187 inferences** mapped to findings (the "47 across 4 packs" roadmap claim was outdated — count is much higher). |
| 5c | Findings persistence to PostgreSQL | ❌ Missing | no `Finding` Prisma model | Findings live only in MCP server memory. Recomputed from evidence on cold start. **Change detection broken** because there's no persisted previous-cycle snapshot. |
| 5d | Evidence ↔ finding linkage | ❌ Missing | FindingProjection has no `evidence_ids` array | Cannot trace a finding back to the HTTP response or DOM element that produced it. |
| 5e | Behavioral findings (12 hardened + 20 cohort) | ⚠️ Dormant | recompute.ts:343-369 gated on ≥20 sessions | Require pixel data which never arrives (see Phase 8). Not callable in production today. |
| 5f | Root cause consolidation 32 → 24 | ❌ Not done | packages/intelligence/root-causes.ts | Still 54+ active keys. ROADMAP 2.3 still pending. |
| 5g | Confidence audit, truth context, suppression context | ⚠️ Implemented but invisible | packages/projections/types.ts | Fields populated, never rendered in UI. |
| 6 | Frontend pages → MCP/API data | ✅ Works | src/lib/console-data.ts | All 7 console pages use the explicit DataState pattern (`loading`/`ready`/`empty`/`error`/`not_ready`). **No hardcoded/hallucinated data** anywhere except the inventory mock counts above. |
| 7a | Workspaces (4 foundational + SaaS conditional) | ✅ Works | recompute.ts:248-319 | Always created, deterministic. |
| 7b | Behavioral workspaces (7 types) | ⚠️ Dormant | recompute.ts:343-369 | Same gate as 5e. |
| 7c | User Journey map | ✅ Works | api/maps/user-journey/route.ts | Built from PageInventoryItem + SurfaceRelation. **Affected by 4c/4d**: empty inventory → empty map. |
| 7d | Root Cause / Decision maps | ✅ Works | apps/mcp/tools.ts get_map | Computed from inferences + intelligence layer. |
| 8a | Behavioral snippet (`vestigio.js`) | ✅ Production-ready | public/snippet/vestigio.js | 25 event types, privacy-hardened, batched. |
| 8b | Pixel ingest endpoint `/api/behavioral/ingest` | ❌ **Does not exist** | snippet/vestigio.js:20 POSTs here | Snippet posts to a dead URL. Verified: no `src/app/api/behavioral/` directory. **Pixel data never enters the system.** |
| 8c | Pixel processing worker (raw events → SessionAggregate → evidence) | ❌ Missing | packages/behavioral/session-aggregator.ts has no caller | `aggregateSession()` exists, no worker invokes it. |
| 8d | Raw event Prisma tables | ❌ Missing | schema.prisma has no `RawBehavioralEvent` | Only `TrackingPixel` (3rd-party Facebook/Google admin) exists. |
| 8e | Data Sources page environment id provisioning | ⚠️ Fake | data-sources/page.tsx:40 | `ENV_ID = "ENV_" + Math.random()` — generated client-side, no DB binding, no signing. |
| 9a | MCP `verify()` execution chain (orchestrator → executor → recompute) | ✅ Works | apps/mcp/server.ts:217-275 | Submits request, runs Playwright/light probe/etc., recomputes context, returns status. |
| 9b | Frontend "Run Verification" button | ❌ Fake | actions/page.tsx:563 | `onRequestVerification={() => toast.success(...)}` — shows a toast, never calls the backend. |
| 9c | Verification result → Evidence flow | ✅ Works (when invoked) | orchestrator.executeAndRecompute | New evidence is added to the store and projections are recomputed. |
| 9d | `verification_maturity` rendering | ⚠️ Component exists, mostly disconnected | components/console/VerificationBadge.tsx | Badge component exists but is fed `action.verification_maturity` which is rarely populated end-to-end. |

### Critical-path findings (the "Wave 0" set)

The audit found **7 P0 gaps** that block the core value loop. They are not just deferred features — they are places where the code makes a promise (e.g. snippet POSTs to an endpoint, button labelled "Run Verification") that the rest of the system doesn't honour. None of the existing waves cover them, so the roadmap was rebuilt with a new **Wave 0**:

1. **0.1** — Onboarding → ingestion auto-trigger (was ROADMAP 1.1, now richer)
2. **0.2** — Pixel ingest endpoint `/api/behavioral/ingest`
3. **0.3** — Pixel event processing worker (depends on 0.2)
4. **0.4** — Inventory auto-build from parser output
5. **0.5** — Replace inventory mock counts with real data (depends on 0.3 + 0.4)
6. **0.6** — Verification: frontend → backend wiring (frontend toast → real API call)
7. **0.7** — Findings persistence to PostgreSQL (unblocks change detection)

See [docs/ROADMAP.md § Wave 0](docs/ROADMAP.md#wave-0--critical-pipeline-gaps) for full specs of each item with file:line refs and acceptance criteria.

### What was over-claimed in the previous roadmap

| Previous claim | Actual state |
|---|---|
| "47 findings across 4 packs" | 187 inferences mapped to findings (count was outdated — much higher) |
| "Pixel event ingestion: management exists, no pipeline" | Management is also broken (ENV_ID is `Math.random()`); pipeline doesn't just lack a worker, it lacks the receiving endpoint entirely |
| "Onboarding creates org but never calls runIngestion" | True, plus the fix is more involved than wiring one call: the AuditCycle row already exists, so the architecturally-cleaner fix is a poller/worker rather than an inline call from the webhook handler |
| "Phase 0 UX done" | True for the visible pages, but several drawer CTAs are toast no-ops (`onRequestVerification`, `onConfirmResolution`) |
| "Phase 4B behavioral findings shipped" | Code is shipped, but findings are dormant for 100% of orgs because the pixel pipeline is broken — they never have the prerequisite `BehavioralSession` evidence |
| Root cause consolidation 32 → 24 | Not done. Still 54+ active root cause keys. |
| `body_text_snippet` 2000 chars | Still 500 chars. |

### What was correctly described

- Phases 1, 6, 7a, 7c are accurately documented
- Wave 1 UX fixes (1.2-1.5, 1.7-1.8) are all really shipped in code
- Brevo notifications, mobile homepage polish, landing fixes (commits `14b77ee`, `8e71b3c`, `b842d32`) are real and verified
- WhatsApp Coexistence integration (commit `4aa7ce7`) is wired and dormant pending env vars

### Recommended sequence

After the audit and the new ROADMAP Wave 0:

1. **Ship 0.1 first** (smallest fix, highest impact on conversion). This makes the entire onboarding → console flow work for net-new orgs without manual intervention.
2. **Ship 0.4 alongside 0.1** (inventory auto-build is also a quick fix and independent of 0.2/0.3).
3. **0.2 + 0.3 together** (pixel ingest + worker) — these unlock all 12+20 behavioral findings + 7 behavioral workspaces that already exist in code but are dormant.
4. **0.6** (verification UI wiring) — small frontend change, the backend is ready.
5. **0.5** (replace mock counts) becomes trivial once 0.3 and 0.4 are in.
6. **0.7** (finding persistence) — the most invasive of the seven; do last and use it to unlock real change detection.

After Wave 0, the existing Waves 1-4 become meaningful again because the platform actually delivers data through them.

## Summary -- UX Overhaul & Recent Changes (as of 2026-04-02)

### What Changed

The system has undergone a comprehensive evolution from a shell-only prototype to a production-grade intelligence platform. Key milestones:

**Control Plane (Phases 4-5)**
- Organization-centric multi-tenancy: `Organization`, `Membership`, `Environment`, `BusinessProfile`, `AuditCycle` models in Prisma
- Onboarding activation flow: creates org + environment + business profile + checkout (Paddle-primary)
- Auth-gated console with `hasOrganization` middleware check
- Evidence persistence in PostgreSQL (`Evidence` model, `PrismaEvidenceStore`)
- Redis-backed job queue and rate limiting with in-memory fallback
- Admin pricing configuration (per-plan limits, Paddle/Stripe Price IDs)
- Demo seed account (`demo@vestigio.io`) with realistic data

**AI Chat (Phase 5 series: 5A-5H)**
- Claude LLM integration: 3-layer security pipeline (sanitizer + fast guard/Haiku guard + output classifier)
- 21 MCP tools with tiered summarization, 30 expert playbooks across 8 categories
- SSE streaming with rich content blocks (11 types: finding cards, action cards, impact summaries, etc.)
- Conversation persistence, cross-conversation memory, token cost ledger
- File upload forwarding, voice input, semantic search (TF-IDF with vector upgrade path)
- Redis rate limiting (sorted sets), abort signal propagation, feedback system

**Engine Maturity (Phases 30-3E)**
- 47 findings (37 negative + 10 positive) across 4 packs
- FindingProjection now carries: `verification_maturity`, `change_class`, `evidence_quality`, `suppression_context`
- ActionProjection now carries: `decision_status`, `verification_maturity`, `change_class`, `resolve_path`, `effort_hint`
- ChangeReportProjection for cycle-to-cycle trend analysis
- Shopify integration (Phase 4A), brand impersonation intelligence (Phase 3E), Playwright network analysis (Phase 2D)

**UX (Phase 5E and Phase 0 UX)**
- Chat: complete rewrite with conversation sidebar, model selector, playbooks drawer, budget indicator, streaming cursor, rich card rendering
- Analysis: suppression context rendering (dimmed/hidden/annotated findings)
- Actions: decision status, verification maturity, change class badges
- Workspaces: change summary with trend indicators

### What Remains

- Ingestion trigger from onboarding (onboarding creates entities but does not yet call `runIngestion`)
- `integration_pull` executor (scaffolded, not implemented)
- Pixel event ingestion (management exists, no ingestion pipeline)
- SPA resolution (Stage D of staged pipeline)
- Conversation export, branching, multi-org analysis
- Full migration from `prisma db push` to `prisma migrate` for production

---

## Wave 1 Frontend Polish -- 2026-04-05 -- Core Experience UX Fixes

### Goal
Resolve all frontend-only items from ROADMAP.md Wave 1. Make the existing console feel complete, self-explanatory, and polished without backend changes.

### Changes

**1.2 Actions — UX Fixes (A-E)**
- Added Observation tab to category filter (was missing despite data existing)
- Renamed "Resolve" column to "Next Step" with clearer button labels: "Mark Resolved", "Run Verification", "Track Progress", "Dismiss"
- Fixed circular "Verify this Verification" text — resolve button now shows only the action label
- Added "Description" section header in action drawer for better context
- Added explanatory text above tab bar explaining Actions ↔ Findings relationship
- Files: `src/app/(console)/actions/page.tsx`, `dictionary/*.json`

**1.3 Analysis — UX Fixes (A, B, D)**
- Added `InfoTooltip` component with (i) button next to Verification header, explaining maturity levels
- Fixed reasoning section — now in its own bordered card, visually separated from severity badges
- Added `PackBadge` component with distinct pastel colors per pack (blue/amber/rose/violet)
- 1.3C (verbose reasoning) deferred to Wave 3 (needs LLM enrichment)
- Files: `src/app/(console)/analysis/page.tsx`, `dictionary/*.json`

**1.4 Inventory — Style Fix**
- Changed findings count from `underline` to `font-semibold` — no longer looks like a broken link
- File: `src/app/(console)/inventory/page.tsx`

**1.5 Chat — Layout Fix**
- Standardized horizontal padding to `px-4 sm:px-6` across all chat areas (header, messages, setup banner, context indicator)
- File: `src/app/(console)/chat/page.tsx`

**1.7 Page Title Tooltips**
- Created shared `PageHeader` component (`src/components/console/PageHeader.tsx`)
- Hover tooltip (?) next to every page title with actionable description
- Wired into: Actions, Workspaces, Analysis, Inventory, Maps
- Tooltip text i18n'd in `console.common.page_tooltips` (en, pt-BR, es, de)

**1.8 Billing — Compare Plans Animation**
- Added `AnimatedPrice` component with ease-out cubic count animation on price change
- Sliding highlight on Monthly/Annual toggle with spring transition
- "Save X%" badge fades in on annual selection
- Strikethrough price animates height/opacity
- File: `src/components/ui/pricing-card.tsx`

### Remaining Wave 1 Items (not frontend-only)
- 1.1 Onboarding → Ingestion Wiring (`platform` + `engine`)
- 1.6 Billing — Fix Broken Button (`platform` — needs Paddle/Stripe integration)

---

## Phase 5 -- 2026-03-31 -- Claude LLM Chat Integration, Deploy Guide, Demo Seed

### Goal
Integrate Claude API into the MCP chat to create a real conversational AI experience grounded in Vestigio's audit data. Three-layer security pipeline (input guard → core model → output classifier). Token cost tracking per org. Conversation persistence. Railway deploy documentation. Pre-populated demo account for onboarding.

---

### A) Deploy Infrastructure

**Railway deploy guide** (`docs/DEPLOY.md`):
- Complete step-by-step guide: GitHub repo setup, Railway project creation, PostgreSQL provisioning
- All environment variables documented (required + optional)
- `nixpacks.toml` build config: uses `prisma db push` (no migrations — first deploy)
- Domain setup, Stripe webhooks, OAuth callbacks, SMTP configuration
- Scaling guidance: replicas, Redis for job queues, connection pooling
- Troubleshooting section for common Railway issues

**Note on migrations**: Project has no `prisma/migrations/` directory — `db push` applies schema directly. Guide includes instructions for when to migrate to `prisma migrate` (once production data exists).

### B) Demo Seed Account (`prisma/seed.ts`)

Pre-populated demo account for product demos and onboarding:

- **User**: `demo@vestigio.io` / `demo1234` (bcrypt hashed)
- **Organization**: "Acme Store" — Pro plan, active, ecommerce
- **Business Profile**: $120k/mo revenue, AOV $85, 2.8% conversion, 0.6% chargeback rate
- **Environment**: `acme-store.com`, production
- **15 pages crawled**: landing, products (3), cart, checkout, pricing, about, contact, privacy policy, blog (2), account, thank-you
- **10 surface relations**: internal links + off-domain checkout redirect to Stripe
- **4 decisions**: `unsafe_to_scale_traffic` (high), `revenue_leakage_detected` (high), `moderate_chargeback_risk` (medium), `revenue_integrity_stable` (low/positive)
- **12 signals**: checkout, policy, trust, measurement, journey, platform, operational categories
- **1 completed audit cycle** + analysis job (100%)
- **VersionedSnapshot** (baseline) with full CycleSnapshot JSON
- **Usage records** + MCP session history

Seed is idempotent (uses upsert). `npm run seed` safe to run multiple times.

### C) Claude LLM Pipeline (`apps/mcp/llm/`)

**Three-model tier system** (backend names hidden from frontend):

| Backend ID | Anthropic Model | Frontend Label | Role | Cost/Query |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|------|------------|
| `haiku_4_5` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | *(internal only)* | Input guard + output classifier | 0 units |
| `sonnet_4_6` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | **Default** | Main conversational model | 1 unit |
| `opus_4_6` | `claude-opus-4-6` | **Ultra** (Pro+ only) | Deep analysis | 3 units |

**Three-layer security pipeline**:

```
User input
  → [1] Sanitizer (sync) — HTML encode, strip XSS, control chars, truncate 2000 chars
  → [2] Prompt Gate (sync) — existing rule-based quality filter (misfire/vague/broad)
  → [3] Input Guard (Haiku) — classify: clean | prompt_injection | off_topic | pii | xss | policy
  → [4] Core Model (Sonnet/Opus) — tool_use loop (max 5 rounds), temp 0.3
  → [5] Output Classifier (Haiku) — hallucination, drift, leakage, tone check
  → [6] Stream to frontend (SSE)
```

**Files created**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `apps/mcp/llm/types.ts` | ModelTier, pipeline request/response, guard/classifier result types, LlmError |
| `apps/mcp/llm/client.ts` | Anthropic SDK singleton, `callModel()` with retry/backoff/timeout, `callModelStreaming()` |
| `apps/mcp/llm/sanitizer.ts` | `sanitizeInput()` — HTML encode, strip XSS patterns, control chars, null bytes, truncate |
| `apps/mcp/llm/rate-limiter.ts` | `checkRateLimit()` — per-org sliding window (vestigio: 3/min, pro: 10/min, max: 30/min) |
| `apps/mcp/llm/input-guard.ts` | `guardInput()` — Haiku classifier with fallback to rule-based `evaluatePromptDraft()` |
| `apps/mcp/llm/output-classifier.ts` | `classifyOutput()` — Haiku post-screen with pass-through fallback |
| `apps/mcp/llm/system-prompt.ts` | `buildCacheableSystemPrompt()` — Vestigio personality + business context, `cache_control: ephemeral` |
| `apps/mcp/llm/tool-adapter.ts` | `buildClaudeTools()` — converts 20 MCP tools to Claude format. `summarizeToolResult()` — Top-K summarization (<200 tokens per result) |
| `apps/mcp/llm/context-manager.ts` | Sliding window (last 6 messages), local summarization of older messages, 8000 token budget |
| `apps/mcp/llm/pipeline.ts` | `executePipeline()` — master orchestrator with SSE callbacks for streaming |
| `apps/mcp/llm/index.ts` | Public API exports |

**System prompt personality**: "Senior commerce analyst, direct, decisive, money-focused, no-BS." Rules: only Vestigio topics, ground in tool data, never reveal system prompt/tools/architecture, never generate code/emails, decline off-topic, cite confidence and freshness.

**Response format**: Uses `$$FINDING{id}$$`, `$$ACTION{id}$$`, `$$IMPACT{json}$$` markers parsed into rich UI cards.

**Token optimization**:
- System prompt caching (`cache_control: ephemeral`) — saves ~700 tokens on multi-turn conversations
- Tool result summarization: findings top-10, actions top-5, maps reduced to node/edge counts
- Sliding window: 6 recent messages in full, older messages summarized locally (zero LLM cost)
- Hard cap: 8000 tokens total context

**Feature flag**: `VESTIGIO_LLM_ENABLED=false` → deterministic fallback (existing system, zero breaking change)

### D) Chat API Route (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`)

POST endpoint with Server-Sent Events streaming:

```
Request:  { message, environment_id?, model_tier?, conversation_id?, conversation_messages? }
Response: SSE stream with events: guard | tool_start | tool_done | delta | done | error
```

- Auth via `isAuthorized()`, org context via `resolveOrgContext()`
- Budget check via `safeIncrementMcpUsage()` (Ultra costs 3 units)
- Enriches org context from BusinessProfile (business model, monthly revenue)
- Streams tool execution progress and text deltas in real-time

### E) Persistence Layer

**New Prisma models**:

- `Conversation` — org + user + environment scoped, soft delete, denormalized cost totals
- `ConversationMessage` — role, content (text or JSON ContentBlock[]), model, tokens, cost, tool calls
- `TokenCostLedger` — every Claude API call: model, purpose (input_guard/core_chat/output_classifier/context_summary), tokens (input/output/cache_write/cache_read), cost in cents, latency

**New platform services**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `apps/platform/token-cost.ts` | `calculateCostCents()` — pricing table: Haiku $0.80/$4.00/M, Sonnet $3/$15/M, Opus $15/$75/M. Cache write 1.25x, cache read 0.1x |
| `apps/platform/token-ledger.ts` | `TokenLedgerStore` — InMemory + Prisma implementations, aggregation by org/model/purpose |
| `apps/platform/conversation-store.ts` | `ConversationStore` — InMemory + Prisma implementations, CRUD + soft delete + cost tracking |

**Indexes optimized for**: per-org cost queries, per-conversation history, time-series admin aggregation.

### F) Environment & Dependencies

- Added `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to `package.json`
- Added to `.env.example`: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `VESTIGIO_LLM_ENABLED`
- Added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to production required vars in `apps/platform/env-validation.ts`

### Status: Backend Complete — Frontend Pending

**Done** (8/14 implementation steps + hardening pass):
1. ✅ SDK + env vars
2. ✅ LLM types, client, sanitizer, rate limiter
3. ✅ Input guard + output classifier
4. ✅ System prompt + tool adapter + context manager
5. ✅ Pipeline orchestrator
6. ✅ Chat API route (SSE)
7. ✅ Prisma schema (3 new models)
8. ✅ Token cost + ledger + conversation stores
9. ✅ **Hardening pass** (see Phase 5A below)
10. ✅ Frontend chat types (`src/lib/chat-types.ts` — ContentBlock system)
11. ✅ Rich rendering components (ChatMarkdown, ToolCallStep, FindingCard, ActionCard, ConversationSidebar, ModelSelector, ChatInputBar, StreamingCursor)

12. ✅ Conversation CRUD API routes
13. ✅ Chat page rewrite (streaming, sidebar, model selector, question queue)
14. ✅ Admin token dashboard (API + UI)
15. ✅ Store initialization + typecheck (0 errors) + build

### Phase 5H — 2026-04-01 — Files, Actions, Redis, Embeddings, Memory

7 features implemented resolving remaining MCP.md limitations and improvements.

1. **File upload forwarding** — `PipelineRequest.attached_files` added. Chat route sanitizes files (3 max, 50KB each). Pipeline appends file content to user message as context (`[Attached file: name (type)]`). Full chain: drag-drop → ChatInputBar → useChatStream → /api/chat → pipeline. (`types.ts`, `pipeline.ts`, `route.ts`, `use-chat-stream.ts`)

2. **Action saving API** — `POST /api/chat/actions` created. Saves Claude-discovered actions as ConversationMessage records with purpose `action_saved`. Title (200 chars) and description (1000 chars) sanitized server-side. (`api/chat/actions/route.ts`)

3. **Redis-backed rate limiting** — Dual-mode: auto-detects `REDIS_URL` (Railway injects when Redis added). Uses Redis sorted sets (`ZREMRANGEBYSCORE` + `ZADD` + `ZCARD` + `EXPIRE` pipeline) for distributed sliding window. Falls back to in-memory if Redis unavailable. `ioredis` added to dependencies. Rate limiter is now fully async. (`rate-limiter.ts`, `pipeline.ts`, `.env.example`)

4. **Semantic search for findings** — `embeddings.ts` module: `buildEmbeddingIndex(orgId, findings, actions)` creates TF-IDF-like searchable index. `searchFindings(orgId, query, topK)` returns most relevant items by token overlap + impact weighting + severity boost. Stop words filtered. No external embedding model required (upgrade path to vector model documented). (`embeddings.ts`)

5. **Cross-conversation memory** — `conversation-memory.ts` module: per-org memory persisted in PlatformConfig (key: `org_memory:{orgId}`). Tracks: frequent topics (extracted from messages), findings of interest (from discuss_finding calls), tracked actions, preferences, key insights. Memory context injected into system prompt as `CROSS-SESSION CONTEXT` block. Updated after each conversation turn (fire-and-forget). Capped at 20 items per field. (`conversation-memory.ts`, `pipeline.ts`)

6. **Playbooks verified** — All 6 playbooks confirmed working: Find Revenue Leaks (4 steps, vestigio), Improve Conversion (4 steps, vestigio), Reduce Chargeback Risk (4 steps, pro), Audit Onboarding (4 steps, vestigio), Check Trust & Readiness (3 steps, vestigio), Landing vs App (4 steps, pro). Plan gating and budget checks functional.

7. **MCP.md updated** — Removed 6 resolved limitations (file upload, action saving, rate limiter, embeddings, memory, streaming). Remaining: 6 limitations (down from 14 original). Possible improvements: 9 (down from 15).

**Files created:** `embeddings.ts`, `conversation-memory.ts`, `api/chat/actions/route.ts`
**Files modified:** `types.ts`, `pipeline.ts`, `route.ts`, `use-chat-stream.ts`, `rate-limiter.ts`, `index.ts`, `.env.example`, `MCP.md`
**Dependencies added:** `ioredis`
**TypeScript:** 0 errors.

### Phase 5G — 2026-04-01 — Limitation Resolution: Cards, Feedback, Playwright, Abort

5 limitations resolved from the MCP.md documentation audit.

1. **Finding/Action card resolution** — `done` SSE event now includes `findings_data` and `actions_data` maps (fetched from MCP projections). `useChatStream` resolves `$$FINDING{id}$$` markers against these maps via `resolveCardData()`. Cards render with real title, severity, impact, pack, root cause. (`route.ts`, `use-chat-stream.ts`)

2. **Feedback system** — Complete implementation:
   - `ChatFeedback` Prisma model (rating, sanitized comment, message preview, model)
   - `POST /api/chat/feedback` — saves feedback with HTML/control char sanitization (500 char max)
   - `GET /api/chat/feedback` — admin-only: paginated list with totals
   - `GET /api/admin/usage?view=chat_feedback` — admin dashboard integration
   - `MessageActions.tsx` rewritten: thumbs up/down opens comment field ("What was helpful?" / "What could be better?") with Skip/Submit. Comment sanitized client-side + server-side.
   - `page.tsx` `handleFeedback()` sends messagePreview + model alongside rating+comment

3. **Playwright import chain refactored** — `mcp-client.ts` changed from static `import { McpServer }` to dynamic `require()`. Client-side gets a safe Proxy stub that returns error results. Webpack no longer traces the McpServer → verification → playwright chain for browser bundles. `next.config.js` `resolve.alias` kept as safety net.

4. **Abort signal propagation** — `CallModelOptions` now accepts `signal?: AbortSignal`. Pipeline passes `options.signal` to every `callModel()` call. If external signal aborts, the Anthropic SDK call is cancelled immediately via combined AbortController. Tokens stop being consumed on user cancel or stream timeout.

5. **Voice input** — Already correct: `VoiceInput` returns `null` when `SpeechRecognition` API unavailable. Firefox/Safari (iOS) users don't see the button. Confirmed working.

**Files modified:** `route.ts`, `use-chat-stream.ts`, `mcp-client.ts`, `client.ts`, `pipeline.ts`, `MessageActions.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `admin/usage/route.ts`, `schema.prisma`
**Files created:** `api/chat/feedback/route.ts`
**TypeScript:** 0 errors.
**MCP.md:** Updated — removed 5 resolved limitations, added "Recently Resolved" section.

### Phase 5F — 2026-04-01 — Integration Wiring: 7 Broken Chains Fixed

Final integration audit found 7 gaps where components existed but weren't connected. All fixed.

1. **FileUploadZone wired** — `FileUploadZone` now wraps the chat area in `page.tsx`. Drag-and-drop files are stored in `attachedFiles` state, shown as `FileChip` components below input, passed to `ChatInputBar`, and cleared after send.

2. **Message actions wired** — `onRetry` (re-sends last user message), `onEdit` (sends edited content), `onFeedback` (POST to `/api/chat/feedback`), `onSaveAction` (POST to `/api/chat/actions`) — all connected from `page.tsx` → `ChatMessageRenderer` → `MessageActions`/`CreateActionCard`.

3. **cost_cents in done event** — API route now calculates actual cost via `calculateCostCents()` (not rough estimate) and includes `cost_cents` in the SSE `done` event. Frontend receives real cost data.

4. **mcp_remaining in done event** — API route fetches `getDailyUsageSummary()` after pipeline and includes `mcp_remaining` in `done` event. Frontend can update budget display immediately without waiting for 30s poll.

5. **prompt_suggestion handled** — `useChatStream` now processes `prompt_suggestion` SSE events and calls `onPromptSuggestion` callback. Pipeline weak-prompt suggestions reach the frontend.

6. **updateTotals called** — API route now calls `store.updateTotals(convId, costCents, inputTokens, outputTokens)` after saving messages. Conversation total cost/tokens are properly accumulated.

7. **Conversation rename wired** — `onRename` prop connected in `page.tsx` → PATCHes `/api/conversations/{id}` and refreshes sidebar.

**Files modified:** `page.tsx` (imports, state, handlers, JSX wiring), `route.ts` (cost calc, budget, updateTotals), `use-chat-stream.ts` (prompt_suggestion case, onPromptSuggestion option)

**TypeScript:** 0 errors.

### Phase 5E — 2026-04-01 — Chat UX: Actions, Voice, Files, Search, Markdown, Thinking, Feedback

Complete UX overhaul of the chat interface to match production-grade AI chat standards.

**Enhanced ChatMarkdown** (`ChatMarkdown.tsx` — full rewrite):
- Tables (header + rows with zebra styling)
- Blockquotes (`>` with left border)
- Horizontal rules (`---`)
- Links (`[text](url)` with emerald underline, `target="_blank"`)
- Nested lists (proper indentation via recursive parser)
- Strikethrough (`~~text~~`)
- Italic (`*text*`)
- Code blocks with language label header
- All regexes length-bounded to prevent ReDoS

**Message actions** (`MessageActions.tsx`):
- Copy to clipboard (with checkmark feedback)
- Edit & resend (user messages — inline textarea with submit/cancel)
- Retry (assistant messages — re-run the query)
- Thumbs up/down feedback (assistant messages — persisted rating)

**Thinking indicator** (`ThinkingIndicator.tsx`):
- 3-dot bouncing animation (emerald) with stage label
- Multi-stage: "Thinking..." → tool-specific label (e.g., "Analyzing findings...")
- Shown when streaming starts but no blocks received yet

**Voice input** (`VoiceInput.tsx`):
- Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition) with browser detection
- Toggle recording with pulsing red indicator
- Transcript appended to input field
- Graceful fallback (hidden if browser doesn't support)

**File upload** (`FileUploadZone.tsx`):
- Drag-and-drop zone wrapping the chat area
- Supports: CSV, JSON, TXT, MD, PDF
- Max 2MB per file, max 3 files
- File chips with name/size/remove button below input
- Emerald overlay with drop instructions during drag

**Conversation search + inline rename** (`ConversationSidebar.tsx` — rewrite):
- Search input with clear button, filters conversations by title
- Inline rename: click pencil icon → editable input → Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- Delete with hover reveal

**Cited sources** (`SourceCitation.tsx`):
- Inline clickable pills for findings (red), actions (emerald), maps (blue), workspaces (purple)
- Shows type initial + truncated label + confidence
- Click navigates to relevant page

**Create action from chat** (`CreateActionCard.tsx`):
- Claude can suggest `$$CREATEACTION{json}$$` when discovering new insights in conversation
- Renders as amber card with editable title, description, severity, estimated impact
- "Save as action" button → persists to action store
- System prompt updated to instruct Claude when to suggest actions

**Input bar upgrades** (`ChatInputBar.tsx`):
- Voice input button (microphone icon, integrated with VoiceInput)
- File attach button (opens native file picker)
- Attached file chips shown above input

### Phase 5D — 2026-04-01 — Functional Gaps: Persistence, Rich Blocks, Exploration, Playbooks, i18n

Audit-driven functional improvements addressing 3 critical gaps and 5 high-impact features.

**CRITICAL fixes:**

1. **Chat persistence wired** — `/api/chat` now calls `conversationStore.addMessage()` after each pipeline response. Both user and assistant messages are saved with model, tokens, cost, and tool call metadata. Conversations persist across page reloads. (`route.ts`)

2. **Rich block parsing** — `use-chat-stream.ts` now parses `$$FINDING{id}$$`, `$$ACTION{id}$$`, `$$IMPACT{json}$$` markers from Claude's streaming text. Markers are converted to typed `ContentBlock[]` (FindingCardBlock, ActionCardBlock, ImpactSummaryBlock) and rendered as interactive cards. Tool summarization updated to instruct Claude to emit these markers. (`use-chat-stream.ts`, `tool-adapter.ts`)

3. **Exploration state restored** — Pipeline request now derives `session_context.exploration_state` from conversation history. Previously explored packs, maps, and asked questions are reconstructed from message content. Claude avoids re-suggesting previously discussed topics. (`route.ts`)

**HIGH-IMPACT features:**

4. **Playbooks integrated into chat** — Empty state now shows 3 guided analyses (Find Revenue Leaks, Audit Onboarding, Trust & Readiness) alongside 4 quick-start questions. Each playbook shows query cost. Users can launch by clicking. (`chat/page.tsx`)

5. **Prompt gate suggestions surfaced** — Pipeline now emits `onPromptSuggestion` callback when prompt quality is "weak" with a suggested rewrite. Chat route streams `prompt_suggestion` SSE event to frontend. Users see "Try rephrasing to: ..." without being blocked. (`pipeline.ts`, `route.ts`)

6. **i18n language-aware responses** — System prompt now includes language instruction based on user's locale (detected from NEXT_LOCALE cookie or Accept-Language header). Claude responds in pt-BR, es, de, or en. Technical terms stay in English. (`system-prompt.ts`, `route.ts`, `types.ts`)

7. **Tiered tool summarization** — Findings and actions now use 2-tier summaries: Top 5 with full detail (severity, impact range, confidence, root cause, pack) + Next 10 as compact list. Claude sees enough context for deep analysis while staying within token budget. Includes `$$FINDING{id}$$` usage instructions. (`tool-adapter.ts`)

**Files modified:**
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` — persistence wiring, exploration state, locale detection, prompt suggestion callback
- `src/lib/use-chat-stream.ts` — block marker parser for $$FINDING/ACTION/IMPACT$$ markers, batched state updates
- `apps/mcp/llm/pipeline.ts` — prompt suggestion callback in PipelineCallbacks
- `apps/mcp/llm/system-prompt.ts` — language instruction with LOCALE_NAMES map
- `apps/mcp/llm/tool-adapter.ts` — tiered summarization for findings (5+10) and actions (5+5)
- `apps/mcp/llm/types.ts` — `locale` field added to OrgContext
- `src/app/(console)/chat/page.tsx` — playbook cards in empty state

**TypeScript:** 0 errors.

### Phase 5B — 2026-03-31 — Conversation Persistence, Chat UI, Admin Tokens

**Conversation CRUD API** (`src/app/api/conversations/`):
- `GET /api/conversations` — list by org+user, paginated with cursor, status filter
- `POST /api/conversations` — create new, auto-links to user's org+env
- `GET /api/conversations/[id]` — load with messages, ownership validated (user → org membership)
- `PATCH /api/conversations/[id]` — update title (sanitized, max 100 chars)
- `DELETE /api/conversations/[id]` — soft delete with ownership check

**Chat page rewrite** (`src/app/(console)/chat/page.tsx`):
- Complete rewrite from 625-line monolith to streaming-first architecture
- `ConversationSidebar` (left panel, collapsible): lists conversations grouped by date, new chat, delete
- `ChatInputBar` (bottom): auto-resize textarea, Shift+Enter, model selector pill, char count
- `useChatStream` hook (`src/lib/use-chat-stream.ts`): consumes `/api/chat` SSE, accumulates ContentBlocks in real-time
- Streaming text with emerald cursor, tool call step indicators (spinner→checkmark), collapsible results
- Question queue: type follow-up while streaming, auto-sends when current response completes
- Auto-title: first message truncated to 60 chars
- Model selector: Default (Sonnet) / Ultra (Opus, Pro+ gated with cost badge)
- Empty state with 4 preset commerce questions

**Rich rendering components** (`src/components/console/chat/`):
- `ChatMarkdown.tsx` — lightweight markdown (headings, bold, lists, code blocks). No deps, no innerHTML, React elements only
- `ToolCallStep.tsx` — Claude Code VSCode-style: collapsible step with spinner→checkmark, duration badge, expandable result preview
- `FindingCard.tsx` — inline card: severity bar, title, impact range, pack, root cause, click-to-navigate
- `ActionCard.tsx` — inline card: priority circle, title, cross-pack badge, savings estimate
- `StreamingCursor.tsx` — blinking emerald cursor during streaming
- `ChatMessageRenderer.tsx` — dispatches ContentBlock[] to sub-components (markdown, tool_call, finding_card, action_card, impact_summary, confidence, navigation_cta, suggested_prompts, quote, data_rows)
- `ConversationSidebar.tsx` — collapsible left panel with date grouping, hover delete, active highlight
- `ModelSelector.tsx` — compact pill dropdown: Default/Ultra with plan gating and cost badge
- `ChatInputBar.tsx` — auto-resize, Shift+Enter, model selector embedded, keyboard shortcut hints

**Admin token dashboard**:
- Extended `GET /api/admin/usage` with `?view=token_costs` and `?view=token_economics`
- `token_costs`: per-org token usage table (calls, input/output tokens, cost, model breakdown), period picker
- `token_economics`: margin after token costs per plan, model pricing reference
- New "Tokens" tab in admin usage-billing page with summary cards + org table

**Store initialization** (`apps/platform/store-enforcement.ts`):
- `TokenLedgerStore` (InMemory/Prisma) initialized at startup
- `ConversationStore` (InMemory/Prisma) initialized at startup
- TypeScript: 0 type errors
- Build: verified

### Phase 5C — 2026-04-01 — Hardening Pass v2 (25-Point Audit Remediation)

Second comprehensive audit of the full LLM + MCP implementation. 25 issues found across 21 files — all 6 critical, 9 high, 5 medium, and 5 low severity issues resolved.

**CRITICAL fixes:**

1. **Guard JSON parsing bypass** — Replaced greedy regex `/\{[\s\S]*\}/` with strict first-object extraction using brace-depth counting. Prevents `{safe:false} {safe:true}` multi-object bypass. (`pipeline.ts`)

2. **Output classifier fail-closed** — Changed from fail-open (pass-through on error) to fail-closed (treat as unsafe). Critical issues (hallucination, leakage, off-topic) return fallback message. Non-critical issues (unparseable, tone) pass through. (`pipeline.ts`)

3. **Verification budget off-by-one** — Moved increment BEFORE execution check. Budget enforcement now happens in pipeline (not tool-adapter), with verification calls counted before deciding to block. (`pipeline.ts`)

4. **XSS sanitizer now removes patterns** — Changed from detect-and-log to detect-and-remove. 16 removal patterns: script tags, iframes, SVG, event handlers, javascript: protocol, eval, document/window access, CSS expressions. (`sanitizer.ts`)

5. **Token ledger error logging** — Replaced `.catch(() => {})` with `.catch((err) => console.error(...))`. Includes request ID for correlation. (`pipeline.ts`)

6. **Context trim preserves user message** — Rewrote `trimToTokenBudget()` to remove from middle (index 2+), never the last user message. Summary pair dropped only as last resort. (`context-manager.ts`)

**HIGH fixes:**

7. **Abort signal propagation** — `executePipeline()` now accepts `PipelineOptions.signal`. Checked between every pipeline stage and every tool loop round. Streaming timeout in chat route passes `abortController.signal` to pipeline. Tokens stop being consumed on timeout. (`pipeline.ts`, `route.ts`)

8. **Conversation total size validation** — Added 50KB cap on total conversation content before processing. Individual messages capped at 5000 chars. (`route.ts`)

9. **ChatMarkdown ReDoS prevention** — Bounded regex quantifiers: `(.{1,300}?)` instead of `(.+?)`. Input capped at 5000 chars. Max 500 inline elements per line. (`ChatMarkdown.tsx`)

10. **useChatStream state race fix** — Replaced direct `setStreamingMessage()` calls with `scheduleUpdate()` using `queueMicrotask()` to coalesce rapid updates into single React renders. Prevents text loss during fast streaming. (`use-chat-stream.ts`)

11. **Cost rounding precision** — `calculateCostCents()` now uses integer arithmetic (multiply by 10000, round, divide) at each step to prevent floating-point accumulation errors. (`token-cost.ts`)

12. **Transactional addMessageWithCost** — New method `addMessageWithCost()` wraps message creation + cost update in `prisma.$transaction()`. Prevents inconsistent state on partial failure. (`conversation-store.ts`)

13. **IDOR: getById excludes deleted** — Both InMemory and Prisma `getById()` now filter `status !== 'deleted'`. Soft-deleted conversations are inaccessible. (`conversation-store.ts`)

14. **Expanded injection patterns** — Fallback guard now covers 10 patterns including: "disregard/forget/dismiss instructions", "new/switch/override mode/persona", "repeat your system prompt", DAN/STAN/GRANDMA variants. (`pipeline.ts`)

15. **Period parsing with validation** — `parsePeriod()` validates month 1-12, day 1-31, uses `Date.UTC()` for timezone-safe boundaries, throws on invalid input. (`token-ledger.ts`)

**MEDIUM + LOW fixes:**

16. **System prompt verification guidance** — Explicit cost/budget language: "You have a budget of 1 verification call per request. NEVER call it proactively." (`system-prompt.ts`)

17. **Request ID correlation** — Every pipeline execution generates `req_<timestamp>_<random>` ID. Passed to all log messages, error tracking, and returned in `done` SSE event. Enables end-to-end debugging. (`pipeline.ts`, `route.ts`)

18. **Message ID collision prevention** — useChatStream now generates IDs with timestamp + random suffix. (LOW, `use-chat-stream.ts`)

**Verification:** TypeScript 0 errors. Build fails pre-existing (playwright-core in client bundle — not caused by our changes).

### Phase 5A — 2026-03-31 — Hardening Pass (Security, Reliability, Token Efficiency)

Audit-driven hardening of the LLM pipeline based on comprehensive code review.

**Security fixes:**

1. **Rate limit bypass closed** — `checkAndRecordRateLimit()` now atomically checks AND records every request before any processing. Previously `recordRequest()` was called after the guard, allowing spam of invalid inputs without consuming quota. Also added memory cap (200 entries/org) and periodic stale window cleanup.

2. **Multi-level ownership validation** — Chat API route (`/api/chat/route.ts`) now validates: session → userId → org membership → environment ownership. Previously any authenticated user could pass any `conversation_id` or `environment_id`. Now verifies the environment belongs to the user's org via Prisma query.

3. **Atomic Ultra budget check** — Previously incremented 1 unit first, then tried to add more. Now checks `current + queryCost <= limit` before consuming any units. Returns clear error with remaining budget.

4. **Short input guard fix** — Inputs < 3 chars now go through `fallbackGuard()` rule-based check instead of auto-passing as `safe: true`. Single-char inputs are properly caught as misfires.

5. **Tool result sanitization** — All tool result summaries pass through `sanitizeToolOutput()` which strips control characters before being sent back to Claude as `tool_result` content. Prevents injection via tool output.

6. **Input size validation** — Chat route enforces `MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH = 2000` and `MAX_CONVERSATION_MESSAGES = 50` at the API level, before any LLM processing.

**Reliability fixes:**

7. **Streaming timeout** — `AbortController` with 120s timeout wraps the entire SSE stream. On timeout, sends `error` event with "Request timed out" before closing.

8. **Context summary auto-compaction** — `summary_of_older` is now hard-capped at 600 chars (~150 tokens). When exceeded, oldest entries are dropped automatically. The `compactSummary()` function ensures the summary never grows unbounded. Compaction is internal — never visible to the user.

**Token efficiency fixes:**

9. **Real token accounting** — Pipeline now uses actual `response.usage.input_tokens` and `response.usage.output_tokens` from the Anthropic SDK instead of hardcoded estimates. Guard, core, and classifier tokens are all tracked with real values.

10. **Token ledger wired** — `executePipeline()` now calls `getTokenLedgerStore().record()` (fire-and-forget) for every Claude API call: input guard, each core model turn, and output classifier. Records model, purpose, real token counts, and calculated cost.

11. **Tool safety classification** — Tools classified as SAFE (19 read-only projection tools) vs EXPENSIVE (`request_verification`). Expensive tools limited to 1 call per request. Exceeded calls return a budget message instead of executing. Classification is internal — never exposed to the user or to Claude.

12. **System prompt tool guidance** — Updated system prompt to explicitly instruct Claude: "request_verification triggers expensive external checks — ONLY call when the user explicitly asks." Also added guidance to minimize tool calls: "fewer calls with better analysis beats many superficial calls."

**Files modified:**
- `apps/mcp/llm/rate-limiter.ts` — Rewritten: atomic check+record, memory caps, cleanup
- `apps/mcp/llm/pipeline.ts` — Rewritten: all 12 fixes integrated
- `apps/mcp/llm/input-guard.ts` — Short input handling fix
- `apps/mcp/llm/context-manager.ts` — Rewritten: auto-compaction, capped summary
- `apps/mcp/llm/tool-adapter.ts` — Added: tool classification, sanitization, verification budget
- `apps/mcp/llm/system-prompt.ts` — Updated: tool usage rules, verification guidance
- `apps/mcp/llm/index.ts` — Updated exports
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` — Rewritten: ownership validation, atomic budget, timeout, input validation

## Phase 4B Hardening — 2026-03-30 — Behavioral Snippet, Session Aggregation, and 12 New Findings

### Goal
Harden the behavioral snippet, session aggregation, evidence payloads, and intelligence pipeline with: canonical milestone taxonomy, success/confirmation evidence, field inventory (structural only), handoff/trust continuity, hesitation/friction patterns, CTA operability tracking, journey typing — and 12 new root-cause-driven findings. NOT session replay. NOT heatmaps. NOT analytics dashboard. Behavioral intelligence for decision-first product.

---

### A) Snippet Hardening (`public/snippet/vestigio.js` — V2)

**9 new event types** (total: 25 event types):
- `confirmation_seen` — success/confirmation page detection via URL pattern, title, h1, DOM markers
- `cta_viewed` — CTA scrolled into viewport (IntersectionObserver, 50% threshold)
- `cta_rendered_late` — primary CTA not present at page load, appears after >3s delay
- `hesitation_pause` — 3s+ mouse/keyboard idle on commercial surfaces near CTAs
- `trusted_handoff` — navigation to trusted checkout provider (Stripe, PayPal, Shopify, MercadoPago, etc.)
- `field_inventory` — form field structural metadata: count, kinds, has_sensitive, has_password, has_card_like (NO values captured)
- `input_focus_abandon` — focus on sensitive field (email, phone, card, cpf) then form abandon
- `form_retry` — repeated submission of same form (attempt_number tracked)
- `rapid_backtrack` — page leave within <5s (quick back navigation)

**Canonical milestone taxonomy** (substrate for inference quality, NOT customer-facing):
- `awareness_seen` → `consideration_started` → `intent_expressed` → `conversion_started` → `conversion_completed` → `post_conversion_seen`
- Classified from route/page patterns, persisted in sessionStorage across SPA navigation

**Confirmation / success detection:**
- URL patterns: `/thank`, `/confirmation`, `/order-confirmed`, `/purchase-complete`, `/success` (EN/PT-BR/ES)
- Title patterns: "thank you", "order confirm", "purchase complete", "obrigado", "gracias"
- DOM markers: `[data-order-id]`, `.order-confirmation`, `.purchase-success`
- Emitted with `signals[]` array indicating which heuristics matched

**Field inventory** (structural only, no values):
- `classifyFieldKind()` → email, phone, name, company, address, cpf_cnpj_like, password, coupon, card_like, freeform_message, other
- Detection via input type, name, id, autocomplete, placeholder attributes
- Never captures: actual values, typed contents, freeform text, payment details, passwords

**Handoff / trust continuity:**
- 15 trusted checkout hosts (Stripe, PayPal, Shopify, Square, MercadoPago, PagSeguro, Pagar.me, Braintree, Google Pay, Apple Pay)
- Captures: target_host, provider_guess, return detection, confirmation after return
- Does NOT create separate trust model inside snippet — uses existing trust boundary signals

**CTA operability:**
- IntersectionObserver for viewport visibility (buttons, submit inputs, role="button")
- isPrimaryCta() text matching: buy, comprar, add to cart, sign up, start, subscribe, etc.
- Late rendering detection: CTAs not present at load time, marked as `_vgEarlyPresent`
- Disabled CTA detection via `disabled` attr and `aria-disabled`

**Journey typing:**
- Classified from URL patterns: ecommerce, lead_gen, saas_onboarding, support_reassurance, checkout_billing
- Emitted with page_view/route_change events

**Privacy preserved:**
- All existing privacy rules maintained
- Field inventory = structural metadata only
- No new PII collection
- No raw event storage

### B) Session / Aggregation Hardening (`packages/behavioral/session-aggregator.ts`)

**Extended SessionAggregate** with:
- `highest_milestone` — highest CanonicalMilestone reached in session
- `confirmation_seen` — boolean, success page detected
- `time_to_first_commercial_action_ms` — session start → first CTA click / checkout / form start
- `time_intent_to_conversion_ms` — intent expressed → conversion start
- `time_conversion_to_confirmation_ms` — conversion start → confirmation
- `cta_viewed_count`, `cta_clicked_count`, `cta_rendered_late_count`
- `hesitation_pause_count`, `rapid_backtrack_count`, `form_retry_count`, `input_focus_abandon_count`
- `field_inventories` — structural form metadata (array of FieldInventory)
- `sensitive_input_abandon_kinds` — which field kinds triggered abandonment
- `handoff_started`, `handoff_returned`, `handoff_confirmed`, `handoff_target_host`
- `oscillation_pairs` — SurfacePair[] with oscillation count and page types
- `policy_before_conversion` — policy opened between intent and conversion
- `pricing_then_backtrack` — pricing viewed, then rapid backtrack
- `journey_type` — classified from surface progression

**New types:**
- `CanonicalMilestone` — 6-stage progression taxonomy
- `FieldKind` — 11 field kind labels (email, phone, name, company, address, cpf_cnpj_like, password, coupon, card_like, freeform_message, other)
- `FieldInventory` — structural metadata interface
- `HandoffContext` — target_host, provider_guess, source_surface_id, returned, confirmation_after_return
- `SurfacePair` — surface_a, surface_b, oscillation_count, page_type_a, page_type_b
- `JourneyType` — ecommerce, lead_gen, saas_onboarding, support_reassurance, checkout_billing, informational

**Oscillation detection:**
- Detects A→B→A→B patterns in surface progression
- Builds SurfacePair with count ≥ 2 oscillations
- Preserves page type for commercial pair prioritization

**Journey type classification:**
- Derived from surface types in progression: checkout/cart → ecommerce, pricing only → checkout_billing, onboarding → saas_onboarding, support only → support_reassurance

### C) Evidence / Signal / Inference Hardening

**BehavioralSessionPayload extended** with ~30 new fields:
- Milestone progression counts (awareness, consideration, intent, conversion_start, conversion_complete)
- Timing: avg_time_to_first_commercial_action_ms, avg_time_intent_to_conversion_ms
- Confirmation: confirmation_seen_count, confirmation_seen_rate
- Hesitation: hesitation_before_cta_count, pricing_then_hesitation_count, pricing_backtrack_count, policy_detour_before_conversion_count
- CTA operability: cta_viewed_count, cta_clicked_count, cta_engagement_rate, cta_rendered_late_count
- Form friction: form_retry_session_count, form_retry_rate, form_excessive_field_count
- Sensitive input: sensitive_input_abandon_count, sensitive_input_abandon_top_kinds[]
- Oscillation: surface_oscillation_count, surface_oscillation_top_pairs[]
- Conversion retry: conversion_retry_count
- Checkout abandon: checkout_immediate_abandon_count
- Handoff: handoff_without_return_count, handoff_without_confirmation_count
- Sensitive dropoff: sensitive_field_dropoff_count, sensitive_field_dropoff_top_kinds[]

**12 new signals** (signals 9-20 in extractBehavioralSignals):
- All gated by MIN_SESSIONS ≥ 20
- All have rate thresholds to prevent noise
- All use compound evidence (not single-event rules)

**12 new inference functions** dispatched from computeInferences()

### D) 12 New Findings

| # | Finding | Pack | Root Cause | Detection |
|---|---------|------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Users hesitate before conversion due to missing trust signals near CTA | revenue_integrity | behavioral_hesitation_at_commitment | Hesitation pauses before CTA + commercial surface + >5% rate |
| 2 | Users delay conversion after viewing pricing due to unclear value justification | revenue_integrity | behavioral_value_justification_gap | Pricing viewed + backtrack to product + no conversion + >4% rate |
| 3 | Users open policies before converting due to trust uncertainty | chargeback_resilience | behavioral_hesitation_at_commitment | Intent expressed + policy open + no conversion + >3% rate (pre-conversion only) |
| 4 | Primary CTA is viewed but not engaged | revenue_integrity | behavioral_path_disconnection | CTA impressions vs clicks, <5% engagement, min 50 views |
| 5 | Users abandon after interacting with sensitive input | revenue_integrity | behavioral_trust_failure_at_input | Sensitive field focus + form abandon + >3% rate + defensible field kind |
| 6 | Form requires high-effort input before conversion due to excessive or sensitive fields | revenue_integrity | behavioral_trust_failure_at_input | Field inventory >6 fields or sensitive mix + conversion-proximate |
| 7 | Users retry form submission multiple times | revenue_integrity | behavioral_path_disconnection | Multiple form submits + no progress + >3% rate |
| 8 | Back-and-forth between surfaces before dropoff due to unresolved decision friction | revenue_integrity | behavioral_value_justification_gap | 2+ oscillations between surface pair + dropoff + >3% rate |
| 9 | Conversion attempts require multiple retries due to friction in final steps | revenue_integrity | behavioral_path_disconnection | Multiple conversion starts + no confirmation + >2% rate |
| 10 | Users delay action due to late availability of primary CTA | revenue_integrity | behavioral_path_disconnection | cta_rendered_late events + high time-to-first-action |
| 11 | Users abandon after initiating checkout due to lack of immediate feedback or progress indication | revenue_integrity | behavioral_hesitation_at_commitment | Conversion started + immediate abandon + no feedback + >3% rate |
| 12 | Users drop off after entering sensitive information due to perceived risk | revenue_integrity | behavioral_trust_failure_at_input | Sensitive field interaction + immediate dropoff + >3% rate |

**Suppression rules:**
- All 12 require MIN_SESSIONS ≥ 20
- Finding 5 (sensitive input): suppressed if no defensible field kind identified
- Finding 4 (CTA viewed): suppressed below 50 total CTA impressions
- Finding 3 (policy detour): suppressed if policy access is post-conversion
- Finding 8 (oscillation): suppressed if oscillation_count < 2 or pairs too noisy

**2 new root cause keys:**
- `behavioral_value_justification_gap` — value proposition fails to carry the price at the decision moment
- `behavioral_trust_failure_at_input` — trust insufficient at sensitive data capture moment

**All 12 findings fully wired through pipeline:**
- InferenceCategory enum entries (12)
- Signal extraction rules (12)
- Inference functions (12)
- INFERENCE_TO_PACK mappings (12)
- INFERENCE_SURFACES mappings (12)
- INFERENCE_TITLES mappings (12)
- IMPACT_BASELINES entries (12)
- INFERENCE_TO_ROOT_CAUSE mappings (12)
- OPPORTUNITY_INFERENCE_MAP entries (12)

### E) Tests

- Surface normalization (page type classification, tracking param stripping)
- Session aggregation for all 9 new event types
- Milestone progression tracking
- CTA visibility tracking

- Root cause completeness (all 12 mapped)
- No "likely" in customer-facing copy

### Metrics

| Metric | Before (4B) | After (4B Hardening) | Delta |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| Customer-facing findings | 116 | 128 | +12 behavioral |
| Snippet event types | 16 | 25 | +9 |
| BehavioralSessionPayload fields | ~20 | ~50 | +30 |
| Root cause keys | 31 | 33 | +2 (value_justification_gap, trust_failure_at_input) |
| Opportunity templates | ~105 | ~117 | +12 |
| Impact baselines | ~92 | ~104 | +12 |
| Behavioral tests | 0 | 20 | +20 |
| TS errors | 0 | 0 | Clean |

### F) Consultant Refinement Pass (4 fixes)

**1. Parametrized titles for findings 5 and 8:**
- Finding 5 (`sensitive_input_abandonment`): title now shows concrete field type — e.g., "Users abandon after interacting with payment card input" instead of generic "sensitive input". Suppressed entirely when field kind is unknown or `other`.
- Finding 8 (`surface_oscillation_before_dropoff`): title now shows concrete surface pair — e.g., "Back-and-forth between /pricing and /product before dropoff…". Suppressed when concrete surfaces cannot be identified.
- Signal carries `severity:param` encoding through `value` field → inference parses and carries in `conclusion_value` → `resolveParameterizedTitle()` in projections produces the concrete title.

**2. Sub-cause differentiation for findings 5, 6, 12:**
- Finding 5 (`sensitive_input_abandonment`): reasoning now branches by field kind:
  - `card_like` → "payment security reassurance failure"
  - `cpf_cnpj_like` / `password` → "unjustified identity data request"
  - `email` / `phone` → "premature personal data collection"
- Finding 6 (`form_excessive_fields`): reasoning distinguishes form proliferation (multiple forms) from single-form mismatch (excessive fields or sensitive mix).
- Finding 12 (`sensitive_input_perceived_risk_dropoff`): same branching as finding 5, with field-specific risk context (payment security, identity exposure, premature contact capture).
- All three findings now sound clearly distinct to the operator despite sharing the `behavioral_trust_failure_at_input` root cause key.

**3. CTA engagement threshold calibrated by surface context:**
- High-intent surfaces (checkout_reached_rate > 10% or intent milestone > 15% of sessions): stricter threshold — min 30 views, ceiling 8% engagement, higher confidence (70).
- General surfaces: looser threshold — min 80 views, ceiling 4% engagement, baseline confidence (60).
- Severity also scales: on high-intent surfaces, <2% = high; on general surfaces, <1% = high.
- Signal description includes context note ("on high-intent surfaces" vs "across general commercial surfaces").

**4. rapid_backtrack guarded as compound-only:**
- `rapid_backtrack_count` on SessionAggregate carries explicit code comment: "NEVER a standalone finding explanation."
- Signal 10 (`pricing_hesitation_unclear_value`) now requires BOTH `pricing_backtrack_count > 0` AND `pricing_then_hesitation_count > 0` AND `pricingHesitationRate > 2%` — triple compound gate.
- No signal in the engine uses `rapid_backtrack_count` directly as sole trigger.
- The event feeds oscillation pairs, pricing-then-backtrack, and milestone timing — always as compound evidence.

### Architecture Preserved

- No session replay, no heatmaps, no raw telemetry
- No raw PII capture — field inventory is structural metadata only
- No root-causeless findings — all 12 mapped to root causes with business reasoning
- No meta-findings — all 12 have business/action value
- No "likely" in customer-facing copy
- Existing 116 findings unchanged — pure additive
- Snippet remains first-party, batched, non-blocking, beacon-safe
- Source merge rules preserved: Shopify = financial, Snippet = behavioral, Static = structural
- Evidence → signals → inferences → decisions → projections pipeline preserved
- Existing governance gates preserved and extended (MIN_SESSIONS ≥ 20, rate thresholds)
- Phase 4B UI (Inventory, Data Sources, Sidebar) unchanged
- Parametrized findings suppressed when concrete parameters unavailable — never falls to generic title

| `packages/projections/engine.ts` | 12 entries in INFERENCE_TO_PACK, INFERENCE_SURFACES, INFERENCE_TITLES |
| `packages/impact/baselines.ts` | 12 new BaselineEntry records |
| `packages/intelligence/root-causes.ts` | 12 mappings + 2 new root cause keys + titles + descriptions |
| `packages/decision/opportunity-gate.ts` | 12 new opportunity templates |
| `tests/behavioral-hardening.test.ts` | 20 new tests (all passing) |

## Phase 4B — 2026-03-30 — Behavioral Intelligence, Surface Vitality, Inventory UI, and Multi-Touch Attribution

### Goal
Introduce first-party behavioral snippet, surface/session/variant model, heartbeat/vitality, multi-touch attribution, 8 new behavioral findings, Inventory UI, Data Sources page, and navigation split. NOT session replay. NOT raw telemetry. Behavioral intelligence for decision-first product.

---

### A) Behavioral Snippet (`public/snippet/vestigio.js`)

**Lightweight first-party JS snippet (~6KB)**. Async, non-blocking, batched (5s interval, max 50 events/batch), privacy-safe.

**Events captured (V1):**
- `page_view`, `route_change` (SPA-aware via History API)
- `cta_click` (classified: checkout_open, support_open, policy_open)
- `scroll_depth` (milestones: 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%)
- `form_start`, `form_submit` (semantic, no field values captured)
- `page_leave` (with time-on-page)
- `dead_click` (3+ clicks in 2s same area)
- `heartbeat` (surface vitality: timing, error counts)

**Privacy:**
- Never captures typed values, passwords, payment fields, or PII
- Semantic labels via `aria-label` / `title` / `textContent` (max 60 chars)
- First-party only — no third-party tracking
- `navigator.sendBeacon` for reliable unload flush

**Install:** `<script async src="https://app.vestigio.io/snippet/vestigio.js" data-env="ENV_ID"></script>`

### B) Surface / Session / Variant Model (`packages/behavioral/`)

**Surface normalization:**
- URLs → logical surfaces via `normalizeSurface()`. Strips tracking params (utm_*, gclid, fbclid, etc.), preserves meaningful route params, classifies page type (multilingual: EN/PT-BR/ES).
- Surface ID = `surface:{host}:{normalized_path}`
- Variant detection for A/B tests, experiments, query-param variants

**Session model:**
- `SessionAggregate` — compact behavioral summary: surface progression, checkout reached, form started/completed, support/policy opened, backtrack count, dead click count, scroll depth, duration, outcome

**Funnel analysis:**
- `analyzeFunnel()` — per-step session count, drop-off rate, backtrack rate

**Surface vitality:**
- `extractVitalityFromEvents()` — is_live, DOM ready timing, load timing, JS/resource error rates, session count

### C) Heartbeat / Surface Vitality

Snippet emits `heartbeat` event on page load with:
- DOM ready timing, load timing
- JS error count, resource error count
- Page alive signal

Powers:
- Inventory "Live" status per surface
- Surface vitality confidence
- Error rate tracking per surface

### D) Multi-Touch Attribution

Snippet captures attribution context:
- `first_touch` persisted in localStorage
- `latest_touch` captured on each session
- UTM source/medium/campaign, gclid, fbclid, referrer, landing URL
- Associated with session for later correlation with Shopify conversions

**Merge strategy:**
- Snippet attribution does NOT conflict with Shopify traffic context
- When both exist: snippet provides session-level paths, Shopify provides order-level attribution
- Clear precedence: Shopify conversion data > snippet behavioral paths > static inference

### E) New Evidence Types

**`BehavioralSession`** with `BehavioralSessionPayload`:
- Session counts, checkout/conversion rates
- Support/policy interaction rates
- Behavioral patterns: policy-then-abandon, high-intent-detour, support-after-checkout, dead CTAs, retry-then-abandon, stalled steps
- Mobile-specific metrics

**`SurfaceVitality`** with `SurfaceVitalityPayload`:
- Surface identity, live status, heartbeat timestamp
- DOM/load timing, error rates, session counts
- Page type, commercial classification

### F) 8 New Behavioral Findings

| # | Finding | Pack | Root Cause |
|---|---------|------|------------|
| 1 | Users drop off after opening refund or return policies | chargeback_resilience | behavioral_hesitation_at_commitment |
| 2 | High-intent sessions detour into reassurance content before abandonment | revenue_integrity | behavioral_hesitation_at_commitment |
| 3 | Support is being discovered too late to save the conversion | chargeback_resilience | behavioral_path_disconnection |
| 4 | Commercial CTA is visible but behaviorally dead | revenue_integrity | behavioral_path_disconnection |
| 5 | Users hesitate on the purchase step and backtrack into trust content | revenue_integrity | behavioral_hesitation_at_commitment |
| 6 | Critical commercial step triggers repeated retries before abandonment | revenue_integrity | behavioral_path_disconnection |
| 7 | Mobile users fail to progress past the first commercial action | scale_readiness | behavioral_path_disconnection |
| 8 | Funnel step is alive but not advancing sessions | revenue_integrity | behavioral_path_disconnection |

**Signal governance gates:**
- Minimum 20 sessions for statistical relevance
- Rate thresholds per signal (policy abandon > 3%, intent detour > 2%, etc.)
- Mobile signals require mobile-specific session count ≥ 20

### G) UI Changes

**Sidebar navigation updated:**
- "Analysis" → renamed to "Findings"
- New: "Inventory" — surface-level intelligence
- New: "Data Sources" — snippet installation + commerce integrations

**Inventory page (`/inventory`):**
- Normalized surface table (not raw URL explosion)
- Columns: Surface label, Type, Live status, Sessions, Findings count, Discovery sources
- Filters: Live/Not Seen, Commercial/Support/Policy/Other
- Summary cards: Total, Live, Commercial, With Findings
- Clicking finding count → navigates to Findings with surface filter

**Data Sources page (`/data-sources`):**
- Snippet section with copy-to-clipboard code
- 7 platform install cards: Shopify, WordPress, Wix, Framer, Webflow, Vibecoding, Other
- Each card: status badge, platform instructions, copy button, last event timestamp
- Commerce section with Shopify API connect card

### H) Non-Conflict / Source-of-Truth Rules

| Source | What it provides | Priority |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Static crawl | Structural routes, metadata | Baseline |
| Katana | Hidden JS routes, abuse surfaces | Deep discovery |
| Playwright | Runtime behavior, network analysis | Selective verification |
| **Snippet** | Live surface confirmation, behavioral paths, attribution | **Behavioral truth** |
| Shopify | Revenue, orders, refunds, transactions | **Financial truth** |

**Merge rules:**
- Snippet-seen surfaces strengthen "live" confidence
- Static routes without snippet evidence = structurally present, not behaviorally confirmed
- Shopify landing context enriches attribution but does not replace session path data
- Browser verification remains selective truth for runtime behavior

### Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Customer-facing findings | 108 | 116 | +8 behavioral |
| Evidence types | 19 | 21 | +2 (BehavioralSession, SurfaceVitality) |
| Source kinds | 11 | 12 | +1 (BehavioralSnippet) |
| Signal categories | 19 | 20 | +1 (Behavioral) |
| Root cause keys | 29 | 31 | +2 |
| Root cause categories | 16 | 18 | +2 (behavioral_conversion_failure, behavioral_path_integrity) |
| UI pages | 7 | 9 | +2 (Inventory, Data Sources) |
| Snippet events | 0 | 16 types | New |
| TS errors | 0 | 0 | Clean |

### Architecture Preserved

- Snippet is evidence source, not product surface — all findings flow through pipeline
- No session replay, no heatmaps, no raw telemetry in UI
- Surface model normalizes URLs (no infinite URL explosion)
- Behavioral findings are business-grade, not analytics metrics
- Existing packs, findings, MCP, evidence model unchanged
- Snippet data does not conflict with other collection sources
- Performance: batched transmission, passive listeners, `sendBeacon` for unload

### What Remains Intentionally Deferred

- Order bump / upsell step detection (needs deeper snippet instrumentation)
- Full funnel visualization UI (Inventory V1 is table-only)
- Webhook-based snippet status validation
- Real-time surface vitality dashboard
- Cross-session journey stitching
- Deep mobile vs desktop comparison views
- Snippet error alerting

---

## Phase 4A.1 — 2026-03-30 — Shopify Integration Hardening (Quality, Depth, Reliability)

### Goal
Strengthen the existing Shopify integration to production-grade: improve data quality, enrich operational context, harden polling reliability, and make the integration feel trustworthy and "alive" in the UI. No new findings — pure enrichment.

---

### Part 1 — Data Enrichment (3 New Aggregate Categories)

**1. Order Status Breakdown (HIGH VALUE):**
- paid, pending, refunded, voided, cancelled counts
- fulfilled vs unfulfilled counts
- cancellation_rate (cancellations / total orders)
- Purpose: detect operational friction, enrich checkout reliability findings

**2. Discount / Coupon Usage (HIGH VALUE):**
- orders_with_discount count
- discount_usage_rate (% of orders using discounts)
- total_discount_amount
- average_discount_per_order
- Purpose: support pricing integrity findings, detect margin erosion

**3. Payment Method Breakdown (MEDIUM VALUE):**
- Top methods with count and failure count
- concentration_ratio (% on top method)
- Purpose: enrich payment reliability findings, validate dependency risks

### Part 2 — Evidence Payload Extension

**ShopifyStoreMetricsPayload** extended with (backwards-compatible):
- `cancellation_rate`, `pending_order_count`, `fulfilled_count`, `unfulfilled_count`
- `discount_usage_rate`, `total_discount_amount`, `average_discount_per_order`
- `top_payment_gateway`, `payment_concentration_ratio`, `payment_method_count`

**ShopifyRawOrder** extended with:
- `cancelled_at` — cancellation detection
- `total_discounts`, `discount_codes[]` — discount usage
- `gateway` — payment method tracking

### Part 3 — Impact Engine Enrichment (Operational Amplifiers)

**New `OperationalAmplifiers` interface** applied optionally to `estimateImpact()`:

| Amplifier | Trigger Threshold | Effect | Applies To |
|-----------|------------------|--------|------------|
| cancellation_amplifier | >5% cancel rate: 1.15x, >10%: 1.3x | Widens impact range for checkout findings | checkout_integrity, checkout_api_latency, purchase_blocked |
| discount_abuse_amplifier | >40% usage: 1.1x, >60%: 1.25x | Amplifies pricing/abuse findings | promotion_logic_exposed, cart_variant_weak_control, economic_exploitation |
| economic_leakage_amplifier | refund+discount compound >8%: 1.15x, >15%: 1.3x | Amplifies economic leakage findings | revenue_leakage, alternate_pricing_safeguard_bypass |
| payment_concentration_amplifier | >90%: 1.1x, >95%: 1.2x | Amplifies dependency risk findings | checkout_provider_fragmented, checkout_provider_path_weak |
| transaction_failure_amplifier | >3% failure: 1.15x, >5%: 1.3x | Amplifies checkout reliability findings | runtime_errors_interrupt_purchase, payment_surface_compromised |

**Backwards-compatible:** `amplifiers` parameter is optional. Existing callers unaffected.

### Part 4 — UI Integration Card Improvements

**Connection validation:**
- `classifyHttpError()` — 401/403 → auth_error, 429 → rate_limit
- `classifyNetworkError()` — timeout/DNS → network_error, parse → data_parsing_error
- Clear status displayed: connected / invalid_credentials / error

**Value feedback (on connection):**
- `buildValueFeedback()` → "Analyzing $124,532 across 1,284 orders (last 30 days)"
- `summary_30d` object with revenue, order_count, currency on ConnectionState

**Sync state:**
- `last_successful_sync_at` — persisted on ConnectionState
- `initial_sync_complete` — boolean flag for UI messaging
- `error_type` — classified error for debugging clarity

### Part 5 — Polling Hardening

**Adaptive backoff:**
- `computeBackoff()` — exponential backoff (2x per failure, capped at 1 hour max)
- Recovery to base interval on first success
- `shouldSkipCycle()` — always skip after rate_limit, stop retrying on auth_error

**Error classification:**
- `ShopifyErrorType`: auth_error, rate_limit, network_error, data_parsing_error, unknown
- Classified in both HTTP and network paths
- Exposed on ConnectionState for UI

**PollingBackoffState:**
- consecutive_failures, current_interval_ms, base_interval_ms, max_interval_ms, last_error_type

### Part 6 — MCP Enrichment

When connected, MCP can now answer:
- "Are cancellations affecting revenue?" → cancellation_rate from order_status
- "Is discount usage unusually high?" → discount_usage_rate + total_discount_amount
- "Is payment reliability concentrated on one provider?" → concentration_ratio + method breakdown
- All via existing projection pipeline with operational amplifiers applied

### Metrics

| Metric | Before (4A) | After (4A.1) | Delta |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Aggregate categories | 4 (revenue, refund, tx, traffic) | 7 (+order_status, discounts, payment_methods) | +3 |
| ShopifyRawOrder fields | 10 | 13 | +3 (cancelled_at, discount fields, gateway) |
| Evidence payload fields | 14 | 23 | +9 |
| Operational amplifiers | 0 | 5 | +5 |
| Error classification types | 0 | 4 (auth, rate_limit, network, parsing) | +4 |
| Connection state fields | 6 | 11 | +5 (last_successful, initial_sync, error_type, summary_30d) |
| UI value feedback | none | "Analyzing $X across Y orders" | New |
| Backoff strategy | none | exponential (2x, max 1hr) | New |
| New findings | 0 | 0 | None — pure enrichment |
| TS errors introduced | 0 | 0 | Clean |

### Architecture Preserved

- No new findings created — existing findings amplified by operational context
- Impact amplifiers are optional (backwards-compatible 4th parameter)
- Poller remains independent of audit pipeline
- All data read-only, no Shopify writes
- Graceful degradation: backoff on failure, auth errors stop retrying
- UI card gets immediate value feedback on connection

---

## Phase 4A — 2026-03-30 — Shopify Integration V1 (Read-Only, High-Value Enrichment)

### Goal
Introduce a Shopify integration that enriches existing findings with real commercial data, enables stronger financial impact estimation, and improves MCP responses with real store performance context. Read-only, safe, minimal setup.

### Principle
> "Findings become financially grounded. Impact estimates upgrade from heuristic → data-driven. MCP answers become materially stronger."

---

### Part 1 — Shopify Adapter Package (`packages/shopify-adapter/`)

**Architecture:**
- `types.ts` — ShopifyCredentials, ShopifyConnectionState, ShopifyStoreMetrics, ShopifyRawOrder, ShopifyRawRefund, ShopifyRawTransaction, ShopifyPollingConfig
- `client.ts` — Read-only Admin REST API client (orders, refunds, transactions). Rate limited (500ms between requests). Timeout enforced (10s). Pagination support.
- `aggregator.ts` — Aggregates raw orders into compact time-window summaries (7d, 30d, 90d). Revenue, refunds, transactions, traffic context.
- `mapper.ts` — Maps ShopifyStoreMetrics → BusinessInputs for impact engine. Includes `determineBasisType()` and `computeDataConfidenceBoost()`.
- `index.ts` — barrel export

**Data Strategy:**
- NOT a Shopify mirror
- Time-window aggregates only (7d, 30d, 90d)
- Compact summaries for impact, trend, correlation
- Max 10 pages of orders per fetch (safety limit)

**Required Scopes (read-only):**
- `read_orders` — orders, refunds, transactions
- `read_customers` — customer journey context

### Part 2 — Shopify Poller Worker (`workers/shopify/poller.ts`)

**Polling strategy:**
- Default interval: 5 minutes
- Incremental fetch (cursor-based on order ID)
- Full window fetch for initial sync (90d covers all windows)
- Graceful failure (never blocks audit pipeline)
- Connection verification before each poll cycle

**Output:**
- `ShopifyPollResult` with: metrics[], business_inputs, basis_type, orders_fetched, cursor, errors
- Feeds directly into `recomputeAll()` via `business_inputs`

### Part 3 — Domain Extensions

**New Evidence Type:** `ShopifyStoreMetrics` (`shopify_store_metrics`)
**New Source Kind:** `ShopifyIntegration` (`shopify_integration`)

**Evidence Payload:** `ShopifyStoreMetricsPayload` with:
- Revenue: total, currency, order_count, average_order_value
- Refunds: count, amount, rate
- Transactions: total, failed, failure_rate
- Traffic: top landing pages, top referrers
- Window and timestamp

### Part 4 — Impact Engine Upgrade (CRITICAL)

**Before Phase 4A:**
- No integration data → `basis_type: 'heuristic'`, confidence × 0.6
- Manual onboarding data → `basis_type: 'mixed'`, confidence × 1.0
- Impact ranges widened 50% on fallback data

**After Phase 4A:**
- Shopify data available → `basis_type: 'data_driven'`, confidence × 1.2
- Real revenue/AOV/transactions drive impact calculation
- Ranges tighter (no 50% uncertainty buffer)
- All 108 existing findings automatically benefit

**New `classifyInputQuality()` function:**
| Data Source | Core Fields Present | Basis Type | Confidence Multiplier |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|----------------------|
| Shopify integration | 3/3 (revenue, AOV, transactions) | data_driven | 1.2x (boost) |
| Manual onboarding | 1-2 | mixed | 1.0x |
| No data | 0 | heuristic | 0.6x (penalty) |

**Chargeback rate:** Derived from Shopify refund rate as proxy (capped at 10%).

### Part 5 — MCP Enrichment

When Shopify data is available, MCP responses automatically improve:
- Financial impact estimates use real revenue data
- `basis_type: 'data_driven'` signals to MCP that numbers are grounded
- Higher confidence scores make findings more actionable
- Traffic context (landing pages, referrers) enriches path-specific answers

### Part 6 — Integration Card

**Location:** Data Sources / Integrations screen
**Category:** Commerce Platforms
**States:** not_connected → connected → error → invalid_credentials

**User provides:**
- Shop domain (example.myshopify.com)
- Admin API access token
- API key
- API secret

### Safety Constraints

- Read-only access only — no write endpoints used
- No mutation endpoints — no automated remediation
- Rate limited (500ms between Shopify API calls)
- Timeout enforced (10s per request, 5s for connection verify)
- Maximum 10 pages of orders per fetch cycle
- Graceful degradation — Shopify failure never blocks audit pipeline
- Credentials stored securely (not in evidence)

### Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Evidence types | 18 | 19 | +1 (ShopifyStoreMetrics) |
| Source kinds | 10 | 11 | +1 (ShopifyIntegration) |
| Impact basis_type options | heuristic, mixed | heuristic, mixed, data_driven | +1 tier |
| Confidence on Shopify stores | ×0.6 (fallback) | ×1.2 (data-driven) | 2x improvement |
| Impact range uncertainty | ×1.5 (widened) | ×1.0 (precise) | 50% tighter ranges |
| Findings enriched | 0 | 108 (all existing) | Universal improvement |
| New findings | 0 | 0 | Pure enrichment |
| TS errors introduced | 0 | 0 | Clean |

### Architecture Preserved

- Shopify is an evidence source, not a product surface
- No Shopify-specific findings created
- All enrichment flows through existing pipeline: evidence → BusinessInputs → impact engine → projections
- Impact engine upgrade is backwards-compatible (heuristic fallback unchanged)
- Poller runs independently of audit pipeline
- Connection failures degrade gracefully to heuristic mode
- MCP benefits automatically from higher-quality projections

### What Naturally Belongs to Phase 4B

- Webhook support for real-time updates (instead of polling)
- Additional Shopify data: products, inventory, customers
- Multi-store support
- Historical trend comparison (before/after finding detection)
- Shopify Plus–specific enrichment (scripts, checkout customization)
- Other commerce platforms: WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce

---

## Phase 3E.1 — 2026-03-30 — Brand Impersonation Signal Expansion & Scoring Upgrade

### Goal
Improve recall (find more real threats), precision (reduce false positives), and scoring strength for the brand_integrity pack. No new findings — strengthen existing 6 findings through better detection, weighted scoring, and enhanced signal extraction.

---

### Part 1 — Domain Generation Expansion (`domain-generator.ts`)

**Added 3 new token categories:**

| Category | Tokens Added | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Phishing/Account (24 tokens) | login, signin, account, conta, entrar, acesso, secure, verify, auth, portal, painel, dashboard, confirmar, validar... | loginbrand.com, brandacesso.com, securebrand.com |
| Payment (12 tokens) | pagamento, payment, pagar, pay, checkout, billing, invoice, fatura, cobranca, carteira, wallet | brandpagamento.com, paymentbrand.com |
| Hybrid combos | payment + region | brandpaymentbr.com, brandcheckoutonline.com |

**Typosquat confusions expanded:** Added `e↔3`, `g↔q`, `n↔m`, `m→rn`, `u↔v`, `d→cl`, `w→vv`

**Max candidates raised:** 200 → 300 (with aggressive deduplication)

**New utility exports:** `hasSensitiveTokens()`, `hasPaymentTokens()` for downstream use

### Part 2 — Similarity Scoring Upgrade (`similarity-scorer.ts`)

**Complete rewrite to weighted multi-signal model:**

| Signal | Weight | Category |
|--------|--------|----------|
| domain_similarity (>80) | 25 | MEDIUM |
| domain_similarity (>60) | 15 | MEDIUM |
| brand_token_presence | 15 | MEDIUM |
| title_similarity (>60) | 18 | MEDIUM |
| favicon_match (sim ≥ 60) | 22 | HIGH |
| commerce_signals | 18 | HIGH |
| sensitive_path (/login, /checkout, /verify) | 20 | HIGH |
| credential_capture (password inputs, login forms) | 28 | VERY HIGH |
| payment_capture (card inputs, payment forms) | 28 | VERY HIGH |
| brand_keyword_density (>3 mentions) | 12 | MEDIUM |
| is_active | 3 | LOW |

**Key design decisions:**
- Phishing patterns (login/payment + brand) reach high confidence even with moderate domain similarity
- Visual match (favicon + title) strongly boosts score
- Credential/payment capture signals dominate scoring (28 pts each)
- Marketplace domains suppressed (Amazon, Mercado Livre, eBay, etc.)
- Generic domains with no brand tokens + low similarity + no content signals capped at 15

**New enrichment signals extracted from HTML:**
- `favicon_url` — extracted and compared with root domain favicon
- `favicon_similarity_score` — path/filename comparison (0-100)
- `has_credential_capture` — password inputs, login forms
- `has_payment_capture` — card number inputs, payment forms
- `has_sensitive_path` — /login, /checkout, /payment, /verify in URL
- `brand_keyword_density` — brand mention count in title + body snippet

**Classification tiers updated:**
- High: score ≥ 70 (was 60)
- Medium: 40-69 (was 35-59)
- Low: < 40

### Part 3 — Scanner Upgrade (`scanner.ts`)

**Root metadata fetch:** Now fetches root domain title + favicon URL upfront for comparison baseline.

**Parallel DNS resolution:** Batched in groups of 20 (was sequential).

**HTML enrichment pipeline:** Each active domain now gets full `extractHtmlEnrichment()` analysis producing: title, faviconUrl, hasCredentialCapture, hasPaymentCapture, hasSensitivePath, brandKeywordDensity, hasCommerceSignals.

### Part 4 — Signal Extraction Refinement

**Signal gate upgrades (no new signals — strengthened existing 6):**

| Signal | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| customers_exposed_to_phishing | conf ≥ 70 AND (commerce OR title_sim > 60) | conf ≥ 70 AND (credential_capture OR payment_capture OR sensitive_path); ALSO medium+ conf with any capture signal |
| suspicious_domains_purchase_intent | commerce signals only | commerce signals OR payment_capture; payment capture boosts confidence to 80 |
| external_sites_mimicking_brand | high conf + title_sim > 50 | title_sim > 50 OR favicon_sim ≥ 60, medium+ conf; favicon match boosts confidence to 80 |
| brand_traffic_deceptive_surfaces | typosquat count | typosquat count + credential/payment capture detection; capture boosts severity to high |
| lookalike_domains_competing | unchanged gates | confidence tiers aligned with new 70/40 thresholds |
| brand_diluted_across_variants | unchanged | unchanged |

### Part 5 — False Positive Guardrails

- **Marketplace suppression:** amazon, mercadolivre, ebay, aliexpress, shopee, magalu, americanas, submarino, casasbahia, walmart — score capped at 20
- **Generic domain suppression:** no brand tokens + domain_similarity < 40 + no content signals → score capped at 15
- **Confidence floor:** maintained at 40 for all signals

### Part 6 — Evidence Payload Expansion

**BrandImpersonationMatchPayload** extended with:
- `brand_keyword_density: number`
- `has_sensitive_path: boolean`
- `has_credential_capture: boolean`
- `has_payment_capture: boolean`
- `favicon_similarity_score: number | null`

### Metrics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Domain candidate tokens | ~30 commercial | ~66 (commercial + phishing + payment) |
| Max candidates | 200 | 300 |
| Typo confusion pairs | 8 | 15 |
| Scoring signals | 6 | 11 (+favicon, sensitive_path, credential, payment, brand_density) |
| Marketplace suppressions | 0 | 10 patterns |
| Findings changed | 0 | 0 (strengthened, not added) |
| TS errors introduced | 0 | 0 |

### Architecture Preserved

- No new findings — existing 6 strengthened with better evidence and higher confidence
- No new external tools — existing scanner enhanced
- Performance: parallel DNS batching, same HTTP timeout, no recursive crawling
- Root-only scan first, deep analysis only for high-confidence
- All evidence flows through existing pipeline: evidence → signals → inferences → projections

---

## Phase 3E — 2026-03-30 — Discoverability & Brand Impersonation Intelligence

### Goal
Add two new business-grade packs — **discoverability** and **brand_integrity** — answering distinct business questions about demand capture and brand exposure risk. Discoverability reuses existing evidence (no new collectors). Brand integrity adds a new fast domain-scanning adapter.

### Principle
> "Discoverability explains demand loss, not metadata issues. Brand impersonation feels like revenue + fraud intelligence, not domain scanning."

---

### Part 1 — Discoverability Pack

**Business Question:** "Is the business discoverable, correctly represented, and capable of capturing demand across search, social, and AI-driven surfaces?"

**Pack key:** `discoverability` (always eligible)

**Evidence sources:** Reuses existing PageContent, Meta, StructuredData, Link evidence — no new collectors.

**7 signals extracted from existing evidence:**
| Signal | Gate | What it detects |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| commercial_pages_weak_search_representation | Commercial pages + missing/thin title or description | Lost search click-through |
| social_previews_fail_commercial_value | Commercial pages + missing OG tags (2+ pages) | Wasted social sharing |
| brand_inconsistent_across_surfaces | 4+ commercial pages + <40% brand consistency in titles | Trust erosion in search |
| commercial_pages_unlikely_indexed | 2+ commercial pages with missing canonical or noindex | Invisible demand |
| weak_semantic_intent_signals | Commercial pages + no Product/Organization schema | Poor ranking/AI understanding |
| previews_disconnected_from_conversion | 2+ pages with OG/title mismatch (<30% word overlap) | Expectation mismatch → bounce |
| commercial_pages_not_exposed_for_discovery | 2+ commercial pages with zero internal links | Crawlability loss |

**7 customer-facing findings:**
| # | Finding Title | Root Cause |
|---|--------------|------------|
| 1 | High-intent pages not properly represented in search surfaces | weak_discoverability_signals |
| 2 | Shared links fail to communicate commercial value | weak_discoverability_signals |
| 3 | Brand appears inconsistently across search and sharing surfaces | inconsistent_surface_representation |
| 4 | Commercial pages unlikely to be reliably indexed | commercial_pages_not_exposed |
| 5 | Search and AI systems receive weak signals about page purpose | weak_semantic_intent_signaling |
| 6 | Social and search previews disconnected from conversion intent | inconsistent_surface_representation |
| 7 | Key commercial pages not structurally exposed for discovery | commercial_pages_not_exposed |

---

### Part 2 — Brand Integrity Pack

**Business Question:** "Is the brand being imitated, intercepted, or surrounded by deceptive surfaces that create financial, reputational, or trust risk?"

**Pack key:** `brand_integrity` (always eligible)

**New adapter:** `packages/brand-adapter/` with:
- `types.ts` — BrandThreatType, BrandImpersonationCandidate, BrandScanConfig, BrandScanResult
- `domain-generator.ts` — Generates 200+ domain candidates from brand tokens + commercial suffixes (EN/PT-BR/ES) + typosquatting + TLD variations
- `similarity-scorer.ts` — Multi-factor scoring (domain similarity, brand tokens, title similarity, commerce signals, favicon match)
- `index.ts` — barrel export

**New worker:** `workers/brand-intel/scanner.ts` — Fast root-only DNS resolution → lightweight HTTP check → similarity scoring. Deep analysis only on high-confidence matches.

**Performance constraints:**
- Max 200 candidate domains
- DNS timeout 3s per domain
- Rate limited HTTP checks (10/s)
- Deep analysis only on confidence ≥ 60
- No recursive crawling of impersonators

**Commercial suffix coverage (multilingual):**
- PT-BR: atacado, distribuidora, loja, comprar, venda, ofertas, desconto, liquida, brasil
- ES: tienda, ventas, ofertas, descuento, promocion
- EN: store, shop, outlet, oficial, original, online, promo, deals, buy

**New evidence type:** `BrandImpersonationMatch` with `BrandImpersonationMatchPayload`

**6 signals with confidence gates:**
| Signal | Gate | What it detects |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| lookalike_domains_competing | 1+ high-confidence OR 3+ medium-confidence active | Traffic interception |
| external_sites_mimicking_brand | High-confidence + title similarity > 50% | Content impersonation |
| brand_traffic_deceptive_surfaces | 1+ active typosquat domain | URL mistype exploitation |
| suspicious_domains_purchase_intent | 1+ active domain with commerce signals | Impostor storefronts |
| customers_exposed_to_phishing | Confidence ≥ 70 + commerce OR high title similarity | Phishing fraud |
| brand_diluted_across_variants | 5+ active variants + avg confidence ≥ 40 | Brand authority dilution |

**6 customer-facing findings:**
| # | Finding Title | Root Cause |
|---|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Lookalike domains competing for brand traffic | brand_impersonation_exposure |
| 2 | External sites mimicking brand identity | brand_impersonation_exposure |
| 3 | Brand traffic exposed to deceptive landing surfaces | traffic_interception_risk |
| 4 | Suspicious domains positioned to capture purchase intent | traffic_interception_risk |
| 5 | Customers exposed to potential phishing surfaces | brand_impersonation_exposure |
| 6 | Brand presence diluted across competing domain variants | brand_surface_fragmentation |

---

### Part 3 — Pipeline Wiring

**New domain types:**
- EvidenceType: `BrandImpersonationMatch`
- SourceKind: `BrandIntelScan`
- SignalCategory: `Discoverability`, `BrandIntegrity`
- 13 new InferenceCategory values
- 2 new RootCauseCategory values: `discoverability_gap`, `brand_impersonation`

**Root cause keys added (7):**
- Discoverability: weak_discoverability_signals, inconsistent_surface_representation, commercial_pages_not_exposed, weak_semantic_intent_signaling
- Brand: brand_impersonation_exposure, traffic_interception_risk, brand_surface_fragmentation

**Opportunity entries added:** 13 (all findings have remediation pathway)

**Pack eligibility:** Both always-eligible (all sites need discoverability; all brands face impersonation risk)

---

### Metrics

| Metric | Before (3D) | After (3E) | Delta |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Decision packs | 7 | 9 | +2 (discoverability, brand_integrity) |
| Customer-facing findings | 95 | 108 | +13 |
| Discoverability findings | 0 | 7 | +7 |
| Brand integrity findings | 0 | 6 | +6 |
| Root cause keys | 22 | 29 | +7 |
| Root cause category types | 14 | 16 | +2 |
| Impact baselines | ~71 | ~84 | +13 |
| Opportunity entries | ~84 | ~97 | +13 |
| Evidence types | 16 | 17 | +1 (BrandImpersonationMatch) |
| External tool adapters | 2 | 3 | +1 (brand-intel scanner) |

### Architecture Preserved

- Discoverability pack reuses 100% existing evidence (zero new collection cost)
- Brand scanner is fast root-only resolution (no heavy crawling)
- All findings flow: evidence → signals → inferences → decisions → projections
- No raw metadata or domain-scanning output in customer-facing language
- Confidence gates prevent low-signal noise
- Commercial surface required for discoverability signals
- Both packs always-eligible (all sites benefit)
- Side drawer and MCP fully wired (all 13 findings have complete projection data)

---

## Phase 3D — 2026-03-30 — Consolidation, Coherence, and Hardening Pass

### Goal
Full transversal consolidation pass before further expansion. Fix wiring gaps, semantic duplicates, missing root causes, missing opportunities, scanner-like titles, and gate inconsistencies. Make the system cleaner, sharper, and fully wired end-to-end.

---

### A) Finding Cohesion Changes

**Titles reworded (6) — scanner/technical jargon removed:**
| Finding | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| form_data_leaves_domain | "User data submitted to unrecognized external endpoints" | "Buyer data leaving the domain through unrecognized form targets" |
| guessable_business_endpoint | "Business-critical actions reachable through guessable endpoints" | "Business-critical commerce actions reachable through predictable paths" |
| js_discovered_purchase_variant | "JavaScript-discovered purchase variants escaping the main safeguard model" | "Hidden purchase paths operating outside the main safeguard model" |
| dynamic_route_weak_control | "Dynamic route discovery reveals weaker commercial control surfaces" | "Deeper commerce logic governed more weakly than the visible purchase flow" |
| channel_traffic_divertible | "Customer traffic routable through weakly governed channel surfaces" | "Customer traffic exposed to diversion through weakly governed surfaces" |
| commerce_operations_exposed | "Public-facing operational surfaces threatening commerce continuity" | "Operational admin surfaces publicly accessible near commercial infrastructure" |

**Findings merged:** None — overlap analysis showed that similar-sounding findings have different evidence bases and gate conditions. They rarely co-fire on the same site.

**Findings repacked:** None — pack assignments verified correct.

### B) Pipeline Coupling Fixes — Root Cause Mappings

**CRITICAL FIX: 10 SaaS inference keys had ZERO root cause mappings.** This meant SaaS findings appeared with `root_cause: null`, breaking root-cause grouping, intelligence summaries, and action derivation.

**Added 3 new SaaS root cause keys:**
| Root Cause Key | Category | Inferences |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| saas_activation_barrier | saas_activation_failure | activation_blocked, activation_friction_high, unclear_next_step, landing_app_mismatch |
| saas_product_experience_gap | saas_product_friction | empty_state_without_guidance, navigation_overcomplex, feature_discovery_poor |
| saas_expansion_blocked | saas_product_friction | upgrade_invisible, upgrade_timing_wrong, no_expansion_path |

**New RootCauseCategory values:** `saas_activation_failure`, `saas_product_friction`

### C) Pipeline Coupling Fixes — Opportunity Mappings

**CRITICAL FIX: 29 inference keys had NO opportunity pathway.** Findings appeared as problems with no remediation suggestion.

**Added 29 opportunity entries across:**
- 15 core commerce findings (trust_boundary_crossed, checkout_integrity, policy_gap, revenue_path_fragile, etc.)
- 10 SaaS findings (activation_blocked, unclear_next_step, upgrade_invisible, etc.)
- 4 mobile/runtime findings (mobile_trust_weaker_than_desktop, runtime_measurement_broken, etc.)

### D) Gate / Threshold Audit

**Verified correct:**
- Pack eligibility in projectFindings() covers all 5 packs
- channel_integrity always-eligible (correct — all sites have public channel)
- chargeback_resilience gated by checkout/ecommerce confidence ≥ 0.3
- SaaS gated by saas confidence ≥ 0.6
- Refund-related Katana findings correctly in channel_integrity (abuse surface, not policy content)
- All Phase 2D network signals use commercial-surface requirement
- All Phase 3B deep discovery signals use CONFIDENCE_FLOOR = 50
- Compound signals require both components to independently qualify

**No gates weakened. No false-positive risks introduced.**

### E) Finding Completeness Audit (Side Drawer + MCP)

**Verified for every finding:**
| Field | Status |
|-------|--------|
| title | ✓ All 95 in INFERENCE_TITLES (fallback to vc.cause) |
| severity | ✓ Derived from inference.severity_hint |
| confidence | ✓ From QuantifiedValueCase |
| pack | ✓ All 95 in INFERENCE_TO_PACK |
| surface | ✓ All 95 in INFERENCE_SURFACES |
| polarity | ✓ computePolarity() present in engine.ts |
| impact | ✓ All 95 have IMPACT_BASELINES entries |
| root_cause | ✓ NOW all have root cause mappings (fixed 10 SaaS) |
| reasoning | ✓ From QuantifiedValueCase.reasoning |
| cause/effect | ✓ From IMPACT_BASELINES |
| opportunity | ✓ NOW 84/95 mapped (up from 55) |
| truth_context | ✓ Available when truth_consistency populated |
| suppression_context | ✓ Available when suppression_governance populated |

**Side drawer rendering verified:**
- Frontend consumes: id, title, cause, severity, confidence, pack, polarity, impact, reasoning
- All fields populated by projectFindings()
- No missing critical fields

### F) MCP Readiness

**All findings consumable through:**
- `get_finding_projections` MCP tool
- Root cause grouping now complete (was broken for SaaS)
- Intelligence summary now includes SaaS root causes
- Action derivation now has opportunity pathways for 84/95 findings (up from 55)

### G) Performance / Fragility Hardening

**No collector changes needed** — overlap between static, Katana, Playwright is intentional:
- Static = baseline (cheap, always runs)
- Katana = conditional deep discovery (JS-heavy sites only)
- Playwright = selective verification (gated by plan and cost)
- Network analysis = instrumentation of existing Playwright runs (no new cost)
- Nuclei = curated external evidence (rate-limited, timeout-enforced)

**Each collector enables unique findings** not achievable by others. No redundancy to remove.

### Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Root cause keys | 19 | 22 | +3 (SaaS) |
| Root cause category types | 12 | 14 | +2 (saas_activation_failure, saas_product_friction) |
| Inference keys with root causes | 80/95 | 90/95 | +10 (5 remain intentionally unmapped: commerce_context is _skip_) |
| Inference keys with opportunities | 55/95 | 84/95 | +29 |
| Titles sharpened | 0 | 6 | Scanner jargon removed |
| TS errors introduced | 0 | 0 | Clean |

### What Remains Intentionally Deferred

- **11 inferences without opportunities** — these are compound/positive/informational findings where opportunity generation is not semantically appropriate (e.g., commerce_context, positive checks)
- **Automated alignment tests** — should be added but is tooling work, not a code fix
- **Truth/suppression context UI rendering** — Phase 27 features partially wired, awaiting frontend integration
- **Signal consumption audit** — 25 signals created but not consumed by inferences; these are pre-existing from early phases and need individual assessment before removal

---

## Phase 2D — 2026-03-30 — Playwright Network Analysis in the Collection Pipeline

### Goal
Instrument Playwright/browser verification with deeper network request analysis. Translate runtime network behavior into business-grade findings about conversion suppression, checkout interruption, trust degradation, measurement blindness, and mobile weakness. NOT a DevTools clone — a focused commercial-runtime evidence layer.

### Principle
> "Vestigio can now see important runtime/network downside that was previously invisible. The product became better at explaining why conversion, trust, and measurement fail in real browser conditions."

---

### Part 1 — Network Capture Instrumentation (`workers/verification/playwright-runtime.ts`)

**Added `page.on('request')` and `page.on('response')` listeners** that capture every request during browser verification with:
- URL, host, resource type, method
- First-party vs third-party classification
- Business role classification (payment_critical, measurement_critical, trust_reassurance, commerce_content, third_party_dependency)
- Status, failure reason, duration
- Timing relative to page load start
- Commercial surface detection

**Network Analysis Summary** built from captured requests with business-focused aggregates:
- Payment request health (total, failed, avg/slowest duration)
- Measurement request health (total, failed)
- Trust/reassurance request health (total, failed, latest start time)
- Third-party dependency weight (count, failures, total weight in ms)
- Classified network problems (payment failures, slow payment, measurement failures, trust late loads, third-party excessive weight)

### Part 2 — Network Analysis Types (`workers/verification/browser-types.ts`)

**New Types:**
- `NetworkRequestRole` — 7 business classifications (payment_critical, measurement_critical, trust_reassurance, commerce_content, third_party_dependency, first_party, non_essential)
- `CapturedNetworkRequest` — Individual request with business classification
- `NetworkAnalysisSummary` — Aggregated business-focused summary
- `NetworkProblem` — Classified problem event with severity
- `NetworkProblemType` — 9 problem types

**Classification Patterns (multilingual):**
- Payment: Stripe, PayPal, Braintree, Adyen, Square, Mercado Pago, PagSeguro, Klarna, Razorpay, Mollie
- Measurement: Google Analytics, GTM, Facebook Pixel, Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, PostHog, Hotjar, Plausible, Matomo
- Trust: Intercom, Zendesk, Drift, Crisp, Tidio, Trustpilot, Reviews.io, Yotpo, OneTrust, Cookiebot

### Part 3 — Domain Extensions

**New Evidence Type:** `NetworkAnalysis` (`network_analysis`)
**New Evidence Payload:** `NetworkAnalysisPayload` with business-focused network metrics (NOT raw HAR)

**New Inference Categories (12):**
- CheckoutApiLatencyDegraded, CommercialPagesSlow, PaidLandingOverloaded
- ThirdPartyWeightDelaysTrust, CheckoutBrittleThirdParty, PurchaseBlockedFailingRequests
- MeasurementBreaksRevenuePath, PurchaseBeforeDepsReady, TrustAssetsLateLoad
- MobileHeavyRuntimeChain, MobileTrustPaymentDepsFailing, TrustSurfacesUnstableDeps

### Part 4 — Signal Extraction (`extractNetworkAnalysisSignals`)

**12 signals with governance gates:**

| Signal | Gate | What prevented |
|--------|------|----------------|
| checkout_api_latency_degrading | Commercial surface + payment_slowest > 3000ms | Generic non-checkout slowness |
| commercial_pages_disproportionately_slow | 3+ pages + ratio > 1.5x + avg > 2000ms | Single slow page or uniform slowness |
| paid_landing_overloaded | 15+ third-party + 8000ms+ total weight | Light pages with few dependencies |
| third_party_weight_delays_trust | Commercial surface + 10+ third-party + 5000ms+ weight | Non-commercial or light pages |
| checkout_brittle_third_party | Commercial surface + payment or 2+ third-party failures | Non-commercial page failures |
| purchase_flow_blocked_by_failures | Commercial surface + payment/commerce failures | Non-purchase page errors |
| measurement_breaks_on_revenue_path | Commercial surface + measurement failures | Measurement issues on non-commercial pages |
| purchase_before_deps_ready | Commercial surface + payment/trust > 5000ms start | Fast-loading dependencies |
| trust_assets_late_load | Commercial surface + trust start > 5000ms | Trust assets that load promptly |
| mobile_heavy_runtime_chain | Mobile viewport + commercial + heavy chain | Desktop-only or non-commercial mobile |
| mobile_critical_deps_failing | Mobile viewport + commercial + critical dep failures | Desktop-only failures |
| trust_surfaces_unstable_deps | Trust request failures + third-party failures | No trust dependencies present |

### Part 5 — 12 New Customer-Facing Findings

| # | Finding Title | Pack | Inference Key |
|---|--------------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Checkout API latency degrading purchase completion | revenue_integrity | checkout_api_latency_degraded |
| 2 | Critical commerce pages slower than the rest of the site | scale_readiness | commercial_pages_slow |
| 3 | Paid landing overloaded before buyers reach meaningful action | scale_readiness | paid_landing_overloaded |
| 4 | Third-party request weight delaying the moment of trust and intent | scale_readiness | third_party_weight_delays_trust |
| 5 | Checkout reliability depends on brittle third-party services | channel_integrity | checkout_brittle_third_party |
| 6 | Purchase flow blocked by failing third-party requests | revenue_integrity | purchase_blocked_failing_requests |
| 7 | Measurement continuity breaks on the path that generates revenue | revenue_integrity | measurement_breaks_revenue_path |
| 8 | Buyers reach the purchase moment before critical dependencies are ready | revenue_integrity | purchase_before_deps_ready |
| 9 | Trust and reassurance assets load too late to calm hesitation | chargeback_resilience | trust_assets_late_load |
| 10 | Mobile commerce path degraded by heavy runtime dependency chain | scale_readiness | mobile_heavy_runtime_chain |
| 11 | Support, payment, or trust layers fail on mobile-first sessions | revenue_integrity | mobile_trust_payment_deps_failing |
| 12 | Trust-critical surfaces rely on unstable external dependencies | channel_integrity | trust_surfaces_unstable_deps |

### Part 6 — Duplication Policy

**Target findings merged (3):**
| Target | Reason | Disposition |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| #7 High-intent pages without measurement execution | Materially overlaps existing `runtime_measurement_broken` | Merged — new finding #7 is a stronger revenue-path version |
| #12 Critical commercial resources late on mobile | Same evidence and meaning as #10 (mobile heavy runtime) | Merged into #10 |
| #14 Media spend into weak mobile experience | Same evidence as #10 | Merged into #10 description |

### Part 7 — Root Cause Strategy

**2 new root cause keys:**
- `runtime_commerce_fragility` — Checkout APIs, payment processing, and cart operations suffer from latency, overloaded dependencies, and sequencing problems
- `third_party_dependency_risk` — Trust, payment, and measurement layers depend on external services that fail, load late, or add excessive weight

**Pack distribution:**
- revenue_integrity: 5 findings (checkout latency, purchase blocked, measurement breaks, deps not ready, mobile deps failing)
- scale_readiness: 4 findings (commercial pages slow, landing overloaded, third-party weight, mobile heavy chain)
- channel_integrity: 2 findings (brittle checkout deps, unstable trust deps)
- chargeback_resilience: 1 finding (trust assets late load)

### Part 8 — Metrics

| Metric | Before (3B) | After (2D) | Delta |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Customer-facing findings | 83 | 95 | +12 |
| Revenue integrity findings | ~18 | ~23 | +5 |
| Scale readiness findings | ~11 | ~15 | +4 |
| Channel integrity findings | 14 | 16 | +2 |
| Chargeback resilience findings | ~7 | ~8 | +1 |
| Root cause keys | 17 | 19 | +2 |
| Impact baselines | ~59 | ~71 | +12 |
| Opportunity entries | ~37 | ~49 | +12 |
| Evidence types | 15 | 16 | +1 (NetworkAnalysis) |

### Architecture Preserved

- Network capture instruments existing Playwright verification runs (no new crawler)
- Evidence is typed `NetworkAnalysisPayload` (not raw HAR or DevTools blob)
- All findings flow: network evidence → signals → inferences → decisions → projections
- No raw network output in customer-facing language
- Business classification at capture time (payment_critical, measurement_critical, trust_reassurance)
- Mobile comparison built into signal extraction (not a separate diff engine)
- Governance gates prevent false positives from single events or non-commercial pages
- Selective verification model preserved — no broad telemetry for every page

---

## Phase 3B — 2026-03-30 — Katana Integration for Hidden Logic, Abuse Surfaces, and JS-Discovered Commerce Variants

### Goal
Add Katana as a **conditional deep-discovery adapter** to uncover hidden commercial logic, business-logic abuse surfaces, JS-discovered commerce variants, and alternate actions that bypass intended safeguards. Not a second crawler — a commercially prioritized deep discovery tool that runs only when static discovery is insufficient.

### Principle
> "Katana added a genuinely new discovery dimension. The product expanded beyond narrow path-fragmentation thinking into business-logic abuse and hidden control-surface risk."

---

### Part 1 — Katana Adapter (`packages/katana-adapter/`)

**Architecture:**
- `types.ts` — `CommercialDiscoveryFamily`, `RouteIntent`, `DiscoveryMethod`, `KatanaClassifiedRoute`, `KatanaRawResult`, `KatanaScanConfig`, `KatanaDiscoveryResult`, `KatanaExecutionConditions`
- `commercial-classifier.ts` — Classifies raw Katana URLs into commercially meaningful discoveries with multilingual intent detection (EN/PT-BR/ES)
- `normalizer.ts` — `normalizeKatanaResults()`, `evaluateKatanaConditions()`, `groupByDiscoveryFamily()`, `filterNetNewRoutes()`, `filterWeaklyGovernedRoutes()`
- `index.ts` — barrel export

**Commercial Discovery Families:**
| Family | Intent | What it detects |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| pricing_control | coupon_discount, cart | Exposed promo/discount/coupon routes, cart manipulation surfaces |
| business_logic_abuse | account_action, order_confirmation, billing, refund_return | Guessable or weakly governed commerce endpoints |
| commerce_variant | checkout, cart, pricing, product | JS-discovered alternate purchase/checkout paths |
| support_burden | support_help | Help/FAQ/support routes structurally separated from commerce |
| safeguard_bypass | checkout, billing, pricing | Alternate actions bypassing intended pricing/trust controls |

**Conditional Execution Gates:**
| Condition | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|
| SPA-heavy | scriptCount > 15 OR (bodyWordCount < 2000 AND scriptCount > 5) |
| Low commercial discovery | < 5 commercial pages found by static crawl |
| JS commerce signals | Inline router patterns OR API endpoint signals detected |
| Insufficient for abuse analysis | < 3 commercial pages AND scriptCount > 8 |

**Safety Limits:**
- Max 50 pages, max depth 3, 60s timeout, 10 req/s rate limit
- Same-host only by default
- Commercially prioritized URL filtering
- Only commercially relevant routes enter evidence pipeline

### Part 2 — Katana Runner (`workers/katana/runner.ts`)

**Pattern:** CLI adapter (same as Nuclei runner) using `execFile` (not `exec`). Rate limited, timeout enforced, same-host scoped.

### Part 3 — Domain Extensions

**New Evidence Type:** `KatanaDiscovery` (`katana_discovery`)
**New Source Kind:** `KatanaCrawl` (`katana_crawl`)
**New Evidence Payload:** `KatanaDiscoveryPayload` with: discovered_url, discovery_method, route_intent, discovery_family, is_net_new, is_commercial_surface, appears_guessable, has_visible_safeguards, confidence, commercial_interpretation

**New Inference Categories (10):**
- PromotionLogicExposed, CartVariantWeakControl, HiddenDiscountRefundRoute
- GuessableBusinessEndpoint, AlternatePricingSafeguardBypass
- JsDiscoveredPurchaseVariant, DynamicRouteWeakControl
- HiddenSupportBurden
- AlternateVariantControlBreakdown (compound), DeepCommerceExploitationRisk (compound)

### Part 4 — Signal Extraction (`extractDeepDiscoverySignals`)

**10 signals with per-family governance gates:**

| Signal | Family | Gate | What prevented |
|--------|--------|------|----------------|
| promotion_logic_abuse_exposure | pricing_control | Net-new + (commercial OR guessable) + confidence ≥ 50 | Generic coupon pages already in static crawl |
| cart_variant_weak_pricing_control | commerce_variant | 2+ variants + 1+ net-new + confidence ≥ 50 | Single known cart route |
| hidden_discount_refund_weakness | pricing_control + refund | 1+ net-new + confidence ≥ 50 | Already-known refund policy pages |
| guessable_business_endpoint_exposure | business_logic_abuse | 1+ unsafeguarded OR 2+ total + confidence ≥ 50 | Low-confidence single matches |
| alternate_pricing_safeguard_bypass | safeguard_bypass | Net-new + commercial OR 2+ total + confidence ≥ 50 | Non-commercial legacy paths |
| js_discovered_purchase_variant | commerce_variant (JS) | 1+ net-new JS-discovered + confidence ≥ 50 | Static-crawl-known routes |
| dynamic_route_weak_governance | all families | 2+ JS-discovered + 1+ unsafeguarded + confidence ≥ 50 | Well-safeguarded dynamic routes |
| hidden_support_burden_exposure | support_burden | 2+ support routes + 1+ net-new + confidence ≥ 50 | Single support page |
| alternate_variant_control_breakdown | compound: pricing + variant | BOTH components must independently pass gates | Partial evidence |
| deep_commerce_exploitation_risk | compound: abuse + bypass | abuse (unsafeguarded) + bypass OR 2+ unsafeguarded abuse | Single low-confidence match |

### Part 5 — 10 New Customer-Facing Findings

| # | Finding Title | Pack | Inference Key | Root Cause |
|---|--------------|------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | Promotion logic exposed to abusive discount behavior | channel_integrity | promotion_logic_exposed | deep_commerce_abuse_surface |
| 2 | Cart variants allow weaker pricing controls | channel_integrity | cart_variant_weak_control | deep_commerce_abuse_surface |
| 3 | Hidden discount or refund routes weaken commercial safeguards | channel_integrity | hidden_discount_refund_route | deep_commerce_abuse_surface |
| 4 | Business-critical actions reachable through guessable endpoints | channel_integrity | guessable_business_endpoint | weak_commerce_governance |
| 5 | Alternate commercial actions bypass intended pricing safeguards | revenue_integrity | alternate_pricing_safeguard_bypass | weak_commerce_governance |
| 6 | JavaScript-discovered purchase variants escaping the main safeguard model | revenue_integrity | js_discovered_purchase_variant | uncontrolled_commerce_variant |
| 7 | Dynamic route discovery reveals weaker commercial control surfaces | channel_integrity | dynamic_route_weak_control | weak_commerce_governance |
| 8 | Hidden support actions increase burden instead of reducing hesitation | chargeback_resilience | hidden_support_burden | support_gap |
| 9 | Trust, measurement, and pricing controls break on alternate commerce variants | revenue_integrity | alternate_variant_control_breakdown | uncontrolled_commerce_variant |
| 10 | Deeply reachable commerce surfaces easier to exploit than the primary flow | channel_integrity | deep_commerce_exploitation_risk | deep_commerce_abuse_surface |

### Part 6 — Duplication Policy

**Target findings merged (5):**
| Target | Reason | Disposition |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Client-side routes outside trusted flow envelope | Too similar to #6 (JS-discovered purchase variant) | Merged into #6 |
| Reassurance separated from buyer paths | Already covered by existing `reassurance_routes_disconnected` | Enriched existing |
| Account/billing outside safeguard model | Subset of #4 (guessable business endpoint) | Merged into #4 |
| Commerce logic less governable than visible flow | Duplicative synthesis of #10 | Merged into #10 |
| Support structurally separated from paths | Same meaning as #8 | Merged into #8 |

### Part 7 — Pack and Root Cause Strategy

**No new pack created.** Findings distributed across existing packs:
- channel_integrity: 6 findings (abuse, pricing control, governance)
- revenue_integrity: 3 findings (pricing bypass, JS variants, compound)
- chargeback_resilience: 1 finding (support burden)

**3 new root cause keys:**
- `deep_commerce_abuse_surface` — Exposed discount, cart, and refund routes enable systematic margin abuse
- `weak_commerce_governance` — Predictable business endpoints lack proportional safeguards
- `uncontrolled_commerce_variant` — JS-discovered variants escape the main safeguard model

### Part 8 — Metrics

| Metric | Before (3A) | After (3B) | Delta |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Customer-facing findings | 73 | 83 | +10 |
| Channel integrity findings | 8 | 14 | +6 |
| Revenue integrity findings | ~15 | ~18 | +3 |
| Chargeback resilience findings | ~6 | ~7 | +1 |
| Root cause categories | 12 | 12 | +0 (3 new keys, same categories) |
| Impact baselines | ~49 | ~59 | +10 |
| Opportunity entries | ~27 | ~37 | +10 |
| Evidence types | 13 | 14 | +1 (KatanaDiscovery) |
| External tool adapters | 1 (Nuclei) | 2 (Nuclei + Katana) | +1 |

### Architecture Preserved

- Katana is conditional evidence adapter, not a second full crawler
- Execution order: static pipeline → (conditional) Katana → Playwright selective
- All findings flow: Katana evidence → signals → inferences → decisions → projections
- No raw crawler output to customer (no "URL found", "endpoint discovered")
- Commercial classifier ensures high-signal-only discoveries
- Governance gates with CONFIDENCE_FLOOR = 50 prevent false positives
- Compound signals require BOTH components to independently qualify
- Business-model gating reused (refund/return findings gated for SaaS)
- Multilingual route detection (EN/PT-BR/ES)

### What Naturally Belongs to Phase 3C (Amass)

- Subdomain and DNS enumeration expanding channel footprint
- Shadow commercial surfaces on forgotten subdomains
- Stale DNS entries pointing to decommissioned infrastructure
- Subdomain takeover risk on commercial domains
- These are channel_integrity enrichments, not new packs

---

## Phase 3A — 2026-03-29 — Nuclei Integration + Channel Integrity Pack

### Goal
Add Nuclei as a curated evidence adapter and open a new business-grade pack: **channel_integrity**. Translate technical exposure evidence into customer-facing business findings about fraud exposure, commerce disruption, trust collapse, and abuse risk. Not a vulnerability scanner — a commercial downside interpreter.

### Principle
> "A finding that reads like a CVE gets ignored by operators. A finding that reads like fraud exposure, commerce disruption, or wasted media spend gets budget."

---

### Part 1 — Nuclei Adapter (`packages/nuclei-adapter/`)

**Architecture:**
- `types.ts` — `CommercialDownsideFamily`, `CuratedNucleiCheck`, `NucleiRawMatch`, `NucleiNormalizedMatch`, `NucleiScanConfig`
- `curated-checks.ts` — 15 hand-selected curated checks across 5 commercial downside families
- `normalizer.ts` — `normalizeNucleiMatches()` filters raw matches through curated suite, maps to commercial meaning
- `index.ts` — barrel export

**Commercial Downside Families:**
| Family | Checks | What it detects |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| payment_integrity | 3 | XSS near checkout, external scripts without integrity, missing CSP on commercial pages |
| channel_trust | 3 | Open redirects, permissive CORS, directory listing |
| commerce_continuity | 3 | Exposed admin panels, debug endpoints, environment files |
| trust_posture | 3 | Missing HSTS, mixed content, expired/invalid certificates |
| abuse_exposure | 3 | Unauthenticated APIs, GraphQL introspection |

**Curation philosophy:** Only checks where a match has defensible commercial interpretation. Unrecognized Nuclei templates are silently dropped by the normalizer. Confidence boosted when match is on commercial surface.

---

### Part 2 — Nuclei Runner (`workers/nuclei/runner.ts`)

- CLI adapter using `execFile` (not `exec` — no shell injection risk)
- Runs only curated templates via allowlist
- Rate limited, timeout enforced, max template count capped
- Parses JSON-lines output from Nuclei
- `isNucleiAvailable()` for graceful degradation when binary not installed
- Safety: scoped to target domains, no uncontrolled internet recon

---

### Part 3 — New Pack: `channel_integrity`

**Primary business question:**
> "Is the digital channel exposed to compromise, abuse, or integrity failures that can create financial, reputational, or operational downside?"

**Pack characteristics:**
- Always eligible (all sites have a public channel)
- Added to `PackEligibility` in eligibility.ts
- Added to projection engine pack/surface/title maps
- Root cause categories: `channel_integrity`, `commerce_continuity`, `abuse_exposure`

---

### Part 4 — New Domain Types

**EvidenceType:** `NucleiMatch`
**SourceKind:** `NucleiScan`
**CollectionMethod:** `ExternalToolScan`
**InferenceCategory:** 7 new entries (PaymentSurfaceScriptExposure, ChannelHijackExposure, CommerceContinuityThreat, LowTrustTechnicalPosture, ChannelCompromisePattern, AbuseExposureConditions, CheckoutInfrastructureBrittle)
**RootCauseCategory:** 3 new entries (channel_integrity, commerce_continuity, abuse_exposure)
**NucleiMatchPayload:** check_id, downside_family, matched_at, is_commercial_surface, commercial_interpretation, confidence, severity_weight, technical_detail

---

### Part 5 — New Findings (7)

| # | Finding Title | Inference Key | Pack | Downside Family |
|---|--------------|---------------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Purchase surface exposed to unauthorized script influence | `payment_surface_compromised` | channel_integrity | payment_integrity |
| 2 | Customer traffic routable through weakly governed channel surfaces | `channel_traffic_divertible` | channel_integrity | channel_trust |
| 3 | Public-facing operational surfaces threatening commerce continuity | `commerce_operations_exposed` | channel_integrity | commerce_continuity |
| 4 | Paid traffic landing inside a low-trust technical posture | `traffic_landing_low_trust_posture` | channel_integrity | trust_posture |
| 5 | Commercial channel exposed to compromise patterns that trigger distrust | `channel_compromise_visible` | channel_integrity | compound |
| 6 | Commercial path exposed to abuse-friendly technical conditions | `commercial_path_abuse_friendly` | channel_integrity | abuse_exposure |
| 7 | Checkout trust anchored to brittle public infrastructure | `checkout_trust_brittle_infrastructure` | channel_integrity | compound (payment + trust) |

---

### Part 6 — Target Finding Disposition (10 targets → 7 implemented, 3 merged)

| # | Target | Disposition |
|---|--------|------------|
| 1 | Purchase surface exposed to script influence | **IMPLEMENTED** as `payment_surface_compromised` |
| 2 | Checkout integrity weakened by untrusted execution | **MERGED** into `payment_surface_compromised` — same evidence (script injection near checkout), same commercial meaning |
| 3 | Customer traffic diverted through weak hosts | **IMPLEMENTED** as `channel_traffic_divertible` |
| 4 | Operational surfaces put commerce at risk | **IMPLEMENTED** as `commerce_operations_exposed` |
| 5 | Paid traffic landing in low-trust posture | **IMPLEMENTED** as `traffic_landing_low_trust_posture` |
| 6 | Channel exposed to compromise patterns | **IMPLEMENTED** as `channel_compromise_visible` |
| 7 | Checkout trust anchored to brittle infra | **IMPLEMENTED** as `checkout_trust_brittle_infrastructure` |
| 8 | Stack includes exposed surfaces inconsistent with safe purchase | **MERGED** into `channel_compromise_visible` — same multi-exposure pattern detection, same commercial framing |
| 9 | Commercial path exposed to abuse conditions | **IMPLEMENTED** as `commercial_path_abuse_friendly` |
| 10 | Purchase confidence undermined by technical signals | **MERGED** into `traffic_landing_low_trust_posture` — same trust posture evidence, same buyer-visible impact |

### Metrics

| Metric | Before Phase 3A | After Phase 3A | Total |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Decision packs | 4 | 5 | 5 |
| Unique customer-facing findings | 65 | 72 | 72 |
| Channel integrity findings | 0 | 7 | 7 |
| Curated Nuclei checks | 0 | 15 | 15 |
| Root cause categories | 9 | 12 | 12 |
| Impact baselines | ~42 | ~49 | ~49 |

### Architecture Preserved

- Nuclei is an evidence adapter, not a scanner product
- All findings flow: Nuclei evidence → signals → inferences → decisions → projections
- No raw scanner output exposed to customer (CVEs, template names, protocol details)
- No vulnerability table or scanner dashboard
- Commercial interpretation is the ONLY customer-facing layer
- Curated check registry ensures only high-signal matches become evidence
- Channel integrity pack framed by business question, not by tool
- Pack eligibility always true (all sites have a public channel)

### What Naturally Fits Phase 3B (Katana) and Phase 3C (Amass)

- **Katana (3B):** Deeper JS-rendered crawl feeding more evidence to all packs, especially discovering hidden API endpoints, dynamic form actions, and JS-injected commercial paths that static crawl misses
- **Amass (3C):** Subdomain and DNS enumeration expanding the channel footprint evidence — weak subdomains, shadow commercial surfaces, stale DNS entries that expand attack surface for the channel_integrity pack

---

### Phase 3A Hardening — 2026-03-30

**Feedback addressed:** 3 structural issues identified in initial 3A implementation.

#### 1. Abuse axis deepened

Added 6 new curated checks focused on economic exploitation:
- `vi_abuse_cart_manipulation` — Cart/pricing endpoint manipulation without session validation
- `vi_abuse_coupon_enumeration` — Coupon/promo code endpoint brute-forceable
- `vi_abuse_account_enumeration` — Account existence leakage via login/register
- `vi_abuse_refund_endpoint_exposed` — Refund/cancellation endpoint reachable without auth
- `vi_abuse_rate_limit_missing` — No rate limiting on commercial endpoints
- `vi_payment_sri_missing` — External payment scripts without integrity verification

New finding: **"Commerce exposed to systematic economic exploitation"** (`economic_exploitation_active`) — fires when cart manipulation, coupon enumeration, or refund fraud endpoints are detected. Distinct from generic `commercial_path_abuse_friendly` (API/schema exposure). The split: generic abuse = recon/enumeration capability; economic exploitation = direct margin/revenue theft.

Total curated checks: 15 → 21.

#### 2. Inference chain tightened for low-signal checks

Every family now has explicit gates preventing scanner-like false positives:

| Family | Gate | What it prevents |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| payment_integrity | Requires high-severity OR commercial-surface match | Missing CSP alone on non-checkout page does not fire |
| channel_trust | Requires high-severity OR 2+ matches | Single directory listing or CORS misconfig alone does not fire |
| trust_posture | Requires high-severity OR 2+ matches | Missing HSTS alone does not fire. Only fires on pattern (multiple weaknesses) or critical issue (expired cert) |
| abuse_exposure | Requires commercial-surface match OR high-severity OR 2+ matches | Single GraphQL introspection on non-commercial endpoint does not fire |
| All families | Confidence floor of 50 | Average confidence below 50 across matches = signal does not fire |
| Compound signals | Both component signals must independently pass their gates | Brittle-infrastructure compound only fires if BOTH payment and trust independently qualified |

#### 3. Always-eligible governance strengthened

- **Confidence floor (50):** No signal fires from any family if average match confidence is below 50
- **Severity-weighted gates:** Low-severity-only families require corroboration (2+ matches) to fire
- **Commercial surface gate:** Some families (abuse, payment) require at least one match on a commercial surface to fire as a business finding
- **Compound signals require both components:** The compound `checkout_infrastructure_brittle` signal only fires if BOTH payment_integrity AND trust_posture signals independently passed their own gates
- **Multi-category compound:** `channel_compromise_pattern` requires 3+ exposures across 2+ families with 1+ on commercial surface

**Net effect:** A single `missing_hsts` or `directory_listing` on a non-commercial surface no longer generates any customer-facing finding. The pack fires only when evidence constitutes a defensible commercial downside pattern.

#### Metrics after hardening

| Metric | Phase 3A initial | After hardening |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Curated Nuclei checks | 15 | 21 |
| Channel integrity findings | 7 | 8 |
| Abuse-axis findings | 1 | 2 |
| Signal gates (explicit) | 2 | 7 (per-family + compound) |
| Confidence floor | none | 50 |

---

## Phase 2C — 2026-03-29 — Composite Findings from Current Evidence

### Goal
Squeeze more customer-facing intelligence from evidence already collected. No new collectors. Compose findings from existing policy depth, graph structure, technology detection, runtime classification, checkout/provider signals, and recursive crawl results.

### Principle
> "Before adding new collection, exhaust the intelligence potential of what you already have."

---

### Target Finding Disposition (15 targets)

| # | Target | Disposition | Reason |
|---|--------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Return terms missing details | **KEPT as `refund_terms_too_thin`** | Existing finding already covers word-count thinness. No change needed. |
| 2 | Refund process too vague | **IMPLEMENTED** as `refund_process_unclear` | Distinct from thinness: uses `has_return_window`, `has_refund_process`, `has_contact_info` from policy analysis. Fires when 2+ critical process details are missing even if word count is adequate. |
| 3 | Post-purchase proof too weak | **IMPLEMENTED** as `post_purchase_proof_too_weak` | Distinct from "confirmation absent": fires when confirmation page EXISTS but is too thin (<100 words) to serve as purchase proof. Uses `body_word_count` on PageContentPayload. |
| 4 | Support reassurance too late | **IMPLEMENTED** as `support_reassurance_too_late` | Distinct from `support_hidden_at_purchase` (widget presence) — this is about journey position: support exists but only on secondary pages, not linked from commercial surfaces. |
| 5 | Hidden reassurance routes | **IMPLEMENTED** as `reassurance_routes_disconnected` | New. Uses recursive crawl + graph to find help/FAQ/confirmation pages with no inbound navigation from the main journey. |
| 6 | Commercial route ownership ambiguous | **MERGED** into `secondary_flows_bypass_trust_path` | Same graph evidence + same commercial meaning (multiple entry points = ambiguous ownership). |
| 7 | Alternate flows bypass trust/support | **MERGED** into `secondary_flows_bypass_trust_path` | Already exists. Strengthened reasoning to explicitly cover trust + support + measurement bypass. |
| 8 | Alternate flows bypass measurement | **IMPLEMENTED** as `alternate_flows_unmeasured` | Distinct from #7. Specifically measures analytics presence per commercial page to find untracked alternate paths. |
| 9 | Runtime pushing into weaker fallback | **MERGED** into `runtime_errors_interrupt_purchase` | Runtime failures already covered. The "fallback path" framing is part of the same commercial impact (broken purchase = fallback). |
| 10 | Runtime breaking support/reassurance | **IMPLEMENTED** as `runtime_breaking_reassurance` | New. Combines runtime error classification (widget_failure bucket) with support/reassurance context. |
| 11 | Mobile reassurance weaker than desktop | **MERGED** into `mobile_trust_weaker_than_desktop` | Same evidence (mobile verification result). Trust degradation = reassurance degradation on mobile. |
| 12 | Mobile thinner post-click trust | **MERGED** into `mobile_trust_weaker_than_desktop` | Same evidence, same meaning — weaker trust envelope after arrival on mobile. |
| 13 | Checkout mode weaker provider path | **IMPLEMENTED** as `checkout_provider_path_weak` | New. Combines external checkout + no recognized provider + thin policy coverage = weaker-than-expected payment handoff. |
| 14 | Platform defaults leaving safeguards | **MERGED** into `platform_checkout_risk_unaddressed` | Same evidence (platform + checkout pattern analysis). Existing finding already covers platform-specific omissions. |
| 15 | Trust+measurement break on alternate | **IMPLEMENTED** as `trust_and_measurement_both_absent` | New compound finding. Fires when multiple commercial pages lack BOTH trust infrastructure AND measurement coverage simultaneously. |

**Summary:** 8 implemented, 7 merged into existing findings, 0 rejected.

---

### Policy Analysis Pipeline Fix (Phase 2C Addendum)

Phase 2A added `PolicyContentAnalysis` with `has_return_window`, `has_refund_process`, `has_contact_info`, `has_shipping_info`, `has_cancellation_terms`, `section_count` — but the pipeline only passed `word_count` to the evidence payload. The rich analysis fields were computed but discarded.

**Fixed:**
- `PolicyPagePayload` extended with 6 new fields (`has_return_window`, `has_refund_process`, `has_contact_info`, `has_shipping_info`, `has_cancellation_terms`, `section_count`)
- Pipeline now passes the full `analyzePolicyContent()` result into evidence
- Link-detected policy pages use `null` for analysis fields (page not yet fetched)

**Also fixed:**
- `PageContentPayload` extended with `body_word_count` — already computed by parser but not stored in evidence
- Pipeline now includes `body_word_count` in PageContent evidence
- Used for post-purchase confirmation page quality assessment

---

### New Findings (8)

| # | Finding Title | Inference Key | Pack |
|---|--------------|---------------|------|
| 1 | Refund process too vague to defuse post-purchase panic | `refund_process_unclear` | chargeback_resilience |
| 2 | Post-purchase proof too weak to prevent disputes | `post_purchase_proof_too_weak` | chargeback_resilience |
| 3 | Support reassurance appears too late in the buying journey | `support_reassurance_too_late` | chargeback_resilience |
| 4 | Reassurance content disconnected from the commercial journey | `reassurance_routes_disconnected` | revenue_integrity |
| 5 | Alternate commercial flows operating without measurement | `alternate_flows_unmeasured` | revenue_integrity |
| 6 | Runtime failures breaking support where buyers hesitate most | `runtime_breaking_reassurance` | chargeback_resilience |
| 7 | Checkout sending buyers through a weaker-than-expected provider path | `checkout_provider_path_weak` | scale_readiness |
| 8 | Trust and measurement both absent on commercial paths | `trust_and_measurement_both_absent` | revenue_integrity |

---

### Business-Model Gates Reused

- All chargeback_resilience findings gated by `isChargebackRelevant()` (checkout/ecommerce ≥ 0.3)
- Target 1 and 2 (return/refund terms) — merged into existing `refund_terms_too_thin` which already only fires when `PolicyPagePayload.policy_type === 'refund'` and `word_count < 200`, preventing false positives on SaaS or digital-only contexts
- Target 5 (warranty/exchange routes) — `reassurance_routes_disconnected` uses pattern `/warranty|exchange|troca/` which naturally only matches when those pages exist in the crawl, preventing semantic mismatch on SaaS
- `checkout_provider_path_weak` requires `checkout.mode` signal (only fires when checkout is detected)

---

### Code Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/domain/enums.ts` | +6 InferenceCategory entries |
| `packages/signals/engine.ts` | +6 signal extraction functions |
| `packages/inference/engine.ts` | +6 inference rule functions |
| `packages/impact/baselines.ts` | +6 baseline entries |
| `packages/intelligence/root-causes.ts` | +6 root cause mappings |
| `packages/decision/opportunity-gate.ts` | +4 opportunity entries |
| `packages/projections/engine.ts` | +6 pack/surface/title mappings |

### False-Positive Guardrails

- `support_reassurance_too_late`: Only fires when support pages exist AND checkout indicators exist AND no support links from commercial pages
- `reassurance_routes_disconnected`: Only fires with 5+ pages crawled (meaningful depth) and uses graph edge analysis for connectivity
- `alternate_flows_unmeasured`: Per-page analytics check — only flags pages that specifically lack tracking scripts
- `checkout_provider_path_weak`: Requires external checkout AND no recognized provider AND weak policy — triple gate
- `trust_and_measurement_both_absent`: Compound condition — both policies < 2 AND no analytics AND 2+ commercial pages — prevents single-issue false fire

### Metrics

| Metric | Before Phase 2C | After Phase 2C | Total |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Unique customer-facing findings | 57 | 65 | 65 |
| Findings merged/strengthened | — | 7 | 7 |
| New signals | — | 8 | 8 |
| New inference rules | — | 8 | 8 |
| New baselines | — | 8 | 8 |
| Evidence payload fields added | — | 7 (PolicyPage: 6, PageContent: 1) | 7 |

### Architecture Preserved

- All findings flow canonically: signal → inference → decision → projection
- No new packs, no new meta-findings, no scanner outputs
- Business-model gates reused from `classification/eligibility.ts`
- Chargeback findings gated by checkout/ecommerce eligibility
- No return/shipping/warranty findings forced onto SaaS contexts
- `refund_process_unclear` exploits the full `PolicyContentAnalysis` (return window, process, contact) — not just word count
- `post_purchase_proof_too_weak` uses `body_word_count` on confirmation pages — distinct from "confirmation absent"

---

## Phase 2B — 2026-03-29 — Mobile Runtime, Deep Discovery & Detection Wiring

### Goal
Complete Phase 2 by implementing mobile-aware browser verification, JavaScript console error classification, inline script detection wiring, recursive commercial crawl, and 5 new customer-facing findings from runtime and deeper discovery evidence.

### Principle
> "Mobile is not a separate pack — it is a verification lens. Runtime errors are not scanner output — they become business findings only when they interrupt revenue, trust, or measurement."

---

### Part 1 — Mobile Viewport Support

**PlaywrightRuntime** updated (`workers/verification/playwright-runtime.ts`):
- Added `ViewportMode` type: `'desktop' | 'mobile'`
- `VIEWPORT_PRESETS`: desktop (1280×720), mobile (375×812)
- `RuntimeOptions.viewport` field for mode selection
- Mobile context: real mobile User-Agent (iPhone Safari), `isMobile: true`, `hasTouch: true`
- Desktop context unchanged (Vestigio-Verification/1.0 UA)

Mobile verification can now run the same scenarios on mobile viewport, producing comparable evidence to desktop for trust/path degradation analysis.

---

### Part 2 — JavaScript Console Error Classification

**Browser types** updated (`workers/verification/browser-types.ts`):
- `RuntimeErrorBucket` type: `purchase_interruption`, `navigation_failure`, `tracking_failure`, `widget_failure`, `payment_provider_error`, `general_runtime`
- `ClassifiedConsoleError` interface with bucket, commercial impact flag, confidence
- `classifyConsoleErrors()` function mapping raw errors to business buckets via pattern rules
- Classification patterns for: checkout/payment/transaction errors, Stripe/PayPal/provider SDKs, analytics/pixel/tag manager failures, chat/support widget errors, navigation/route failures
- `buildMobileCommercialScenario()` helper for mobile path verification

Errors are classified, NOT surfaced raw. Only business-impacting classifications become signals.

---

### Part 3 — Inline Script Detection Wiring (Phase 2A Fix)

**Pipeline** fixed (`workers/ingestion/pipeline.ts`):
- `buildTechDetectionInput()` now accepts `ParsedPage[]` as second parameter
- Inline scripts from all parsed pages are wired into `DetectionInput.inline_scripts`
- Body text snippets wired into `DetectionInput.html_bodies`
- `runIngestion()` accumulates `allParsedPages` array and passes to tech detection

This completes the Phase 2A gap where inline scripts were extracted by the parser but never fed to the technology detector. Inline patterns in the registry (gtag init, fbq init, Intercom boot, Drift load, etc.) now actually match.

---

### Part 4 — Recursive Commercial Crawl

**Pipeline** updated (`workers/ingestion/pipeline.ts`):
- After initial page fetching, discovered links from ALL fetched pages are scanned (not just homepage)
- Commercially-relevant links prioritized: checkout, pricing, contact, policy, help, FAQ, confirmation, warranty, exchange patterns
- Constrained to max 10 additional recursive pages
- URL deduplication against already-fetched pages
- Respects existing crawl constraints and loop detection

Discovers: secondary conversion paths, alternate checkout flows, hidden confirmation/help/warranty pages relevant to trust, chargeback, and revenue analysis.

---

### Part 5 — New Domain Types

**EvidenceType additions:**
- `MobileVerificationResult` — mobile viewport verification outcome
- `ClassifiedRuntimeErrors` — business-classified JS runtime errors

**InferenceCategory additions:**
- `MobilePathBlocked`, `MobileTrustDegraded`, `RuntimePurchaseInterruption`, `RuntimeMeasurementBreak`, `SecondaryFlowBypassing`

**Evidence payload additions:**
- `MobileVerificationResultPayload` — commercial_path_reachable, checkout_reachable, trust_degraded_vs_desktop, steps
- `ClassifiedRuntimeErrorsPayload` — errors by bucket, commercial impact count, viewport tag

---

### Part 6 — New Findings (5 Implemented)

| # | Finding Title | Inference Key | Pack | Evidence Source |
|---|--------------|---------------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Mobile navigation blocking access to commercial paths | `mobile_commercial_path_blocked` | scale_readiness | MobileVerificationResult where commercial path unreachable |
| 2 | Mobile buyers routed into weaker trust experience than desktop | `mobile_trust_weaker_than_desktop` | revenue_integrity | MobileVerificationResult where trust_degraded_vs_desktop=true |
| 3 | Runtime failures interrupting the purchase journey | `runtime_errors_interrupt_purchase` | revenue_integrity | ClassifiedRuntimeErrors with purchase_interruption/payment_provider buckets |
| 4 | Runtime failures weakening measurement on high-intent paths | `runtime_measurement_broken` | revenue_integrity | ClassifiedRuntimeErrors with tracking_failure bucket |
| 5 | Secondary commercial flows bypassing the main trust path | `secondary_flows_bypass_trust_path` | revenue_integrity | Graph analysis: 3+ distinct commercial entry points suggesting alternate flows |

---

### Target Finding Disposition

| Target | Disposition | Reason |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Mobile navigation blocking commercial paths | **Implemented** | `mobile_commercial_path_blocked` |
| Mobile checkout path degrades before conversion | **Merged** into mobile_commercial_path_blocked | Same evidence, same signal — checkout reachability is part of commercial path assessment |
| JS errors interrupt mobile purchase journey | **Implemented** | `runtime_errors_interrupt_purchase` (not mobile-only — fires on any viewport) |
| Mobile buyers weaker trust than desktop | **Implemented** | `mobile_trust_weaker_than_desktop` |
| Secondary flows bypass trust path | **Implemented** | `secondary_flows_bypass_trust_path` |
| Hidden support/reassurance off main journey | **Deferred** | Recursive crawl discovers these pages, but translating "hidden help page" into a business finding requires stronger graph path analysis than currently available |
| Runtime failures weakening measurement | **Implemented** | `runtime_measurement_broken` |
| Mobile path weaker than launch-ready threshold | **Merged** into mobile_commercial_path_blocked | Mobile path blocking IS a launch readiness finding (mapped to scale_readiness pack) |

---

### Code Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `workers/verification/playwright-runtime.ts` | +ViewportMode, VIEWPORT_PRESETS, mobile context support |
| `workers/verification/browser-types.ts` | +RuntimeErrorBucket, ClassifiedConsoleError, classifyConsoleErrors(), buildMobileCommercialScenario() |

### Metrics

| Metric | Before Phase 2B | After Phase 2B | Total |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Unique customer-facing findings | 52 | 57 | 57 |
| Mobile-specific findings | 0 | 2 | 2 |
| Runtime-based findings | 0 | 2 | 2 |
| Discovery-based findings | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| Technology registry inline patterns working | No | Yes | Yes |
| Recursive commercial crawl | No | Yes (max 10 pages) | Yes |
| Mobile viewport support | No | Yes (375×812) | Yes |
| Console error classification | No | Yes (6 buckets) | Yes |

### Architecture Preserved

- Mobile findings go into scale_readiness and revenue_integrity — NOT a separate mobile pack
- Runtime errors are classified into business buckets, not surfaced raw
- All findings flow canonically: evidence → signal → inference → decision → projection
- No scanner-style findings ("JS error found", "mobile layout broken")
- No meta-findings exposed
- Technology registry remains centralized
- Recursive crawl is constrained and commercially prioritized

### What Is Deferred

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Desktop/mobile comparison finding (side-by-side diff) | Requires orchestrated dual-viewport run; mobile evidence types are ready but comparison logic needs dedicated orchestration |
| Hidden support pages finding | Recursive crawl discovers them but translating "unreachable help page" into a business finding needs stronger graph path scoring |
| Mobile form interaction testing | Requires Playwright step execution on mobile forms; viewport support is ready but scenario builder needs CTA detection |

---

## Phase 2 — 2026-03-29 — Collection Deepening & Technology Stack

### Goal
Deepen the existing collection pipeline to produce a larger and more useful set of business-grade findings. Add technology stack recognition, extend the HTML parser, integrate a centralized technology registry, and deliver 5 new customer-facing findings from the deepened evidence.

### Principle
> "Deeper evidence, not noisier evidence. Technology recognition that improves product clarity and commercial intelligence — not scanner output."

---

### Part 1 — Technology Stack Registry (`packages/technology-registry/`)

Created an extensible, centralized technology recognition system.

**Structure:**
- `types.ts` — `TechnologyCategory`, `TechnologyDefinition`, `DetectedTechnology`, `TechnologyStackProjection`
- `registry.ts` — 45+ technology definitions across 10 categories with regex detection patterns
- `detector.ts` — `detectTechnologies()` + `buildTechnologyStackProjection()` for frontend
- `index.ts` — barrel export

**Categories:**
| Category | Technologies |
|----------|-------------|
| platform | Shopify, WordPress, WooCommerce, Magento, Wix, Squarespace, VTEX, Nuvemshop |
| payment_provider | Stripe, PayPal, Mercado Pago, PagSeguro, Adyen, Braintree, Square, Klarna, Afterpay |
| analytics | Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, Hotjar, PostHog, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap, Segment, Plausible |
| tag_manager | Google Tag Manager, Tealium |
| support_widget | Intercom, Drift, Zendesk, Freshdesk, Crisp, Tidio, LiveChat, tawk.to |
| consent_manager | OneTrust, Cookiebot, Didomi |
| error_tracking | Sentry, Bugsnag, LogRocket |
| ab_testing | Optimizely, VWO |

**Logo asset directory:** `public/logos/technologies/` with README explaining naming convention.

**Frontend data contract:** `TechnologyStackProjection` provides:
- `technologies[]` — all detected technologies
- `by_category` — grouped for UI rendering
- `summary` — boolean flags (has_analytics, has_support_widget, etc.) + provider/platform lists

**Extensibility:** Adding a new technology = add one entry to `TECHNOLOGY_REGISTRY` + drop a logo SVG file. No code changes needed elsewhere.

---

### Part 2 — Parser Deepening (`workers/ingestion/parser.ts`)

**Inline script extraction:**
- Extracts content from `<script>` tags without `src` attribute
- Caps at 2KB per script to avoid memory issues
- Used by technology registry for detecting inline initializations (gtag, fbq, Intercom boot, etc.)

**Structured data extraction (JSON-LD):**
- Parses `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks
- Handles `@graph` arrays and nested structures
- Produces `ParsedStructuredData` with type, name, and raw data
- Trust-relevant types: Organization, LocalBusiness, Store, Brand
- Commerce-relevant types: Product, Offer, AggregateOffer

**Body text extraction and word count:**
- Strips HTML tags, scripts, styles to produce clean body text
- Counts words per page (`body_word_count`)
- Used for policy content depth analysis

**Policy content analysis (`analyzePolicyContent()`):**
- Word count
- Return window detection (e.g. "30 days")
- Refund process mention detection
- Contact info presence
- Shipping/cancellation terms
- Section count (heading density)
- Thin policy flag (< 200 words)

---

### Part 3 — Pipeline Integration (`workers/ingestion/pipeline.ts`)

**New evidence types produced:**
- `InlineScriptContent` — page-level inline script marker with pattern count
- `StructuredDataItem` — per-item JSON-LD evidence with trust/commerce classification
- `TechnologyDetected` — per-technology evidence from registry detection

**Policy page enrichment:**
- When a fetched page IS a policy page (by URL pattern), body word count is now computed and stored in `PolicyPagePayload.word_count` (previously always null)
- `analyzePolicyContent()` provides structured quality metrics

**Technology detection integration:**
- After all pages are fetched and parsed, `buildTechDetectionInput()` collects script_srcs and iframe_srcs from evidence
- `detectTechnologies()` runs the registry against all collected data
- Each detected technology produces a `TechnologyDetected` evidence item

---

### Part 4 — New Domain Types

**EvidenceType additions:**
- `InlineScriptContent`, `StructuredDataItem`, `TechnologyDetected`

**InferenceCategory additions:**
- `ThinPolicyContent`, `HiddenSupportWidget`, `TrustSignalsThin`, `TrackingStackIncomplete`, `ConsentMeasurementConflict`, `MobileCheckoutDegraded`

**Evidence payload additions:**
- `InlineScriptContentPayload` — page_url, detected_patterns[], total_inline_scripts
- `StructuredDataItemPayload` — schema_type, name, is_trust_signal, is_commerce_signal
- `TechnologyDetectedPayload` — technology_key, display_name, category, confidence, logo_key, detected_on[]

---

### Part 5 — New Findings (5 Implemented)

| # | Finding Title | Inference Key | Pack | Evidence Source |
|---|--------------|---------------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Refund and return terms too thin to defuse disputes | `refund_terms_too_thin` | chargeback_resilience | PolicyPagePayload.word_count < 200 on refund page |
| 2 | Support exists but hidden when buyers need reassurance | `support_hidden_at_purchase` | chargeback_resilience | TechnologyDetected (support_widget) present but not on checkout pages |
| 3 | Commercial trust signals too thin on high-intent surfaces | `trust_surface_too_thin` | scale_readiness | StructuredDataItem (trust types) + PolicyPage + ProviderIndicator count < 2 |
| 4 | High-intent tracking stack incomplete where optimization matters | `tracking_stack_gaps` | scale_readiness | TechnologyDetected: missing analytics or tag_manager on commerce site |
| 5 | Consent setup silently undermining measurement continuity | `consent_undermining_measurement` | revenue_integrity | consent_manager detected + no tag_manager + analytics present |

### Part 6 — Mobile Findings (Deferred to Phase 2B)

Mobile viewport testing and mobile-specific findings require Playwright viewport changes and targeted browser verification scenarios. These are architecturally prepared (InferenceCategory.MobileCheckoutDegraded is defined) but implementation requires:
- Browser verification configuration for mobile viewport (375x812)
- Mobile-specific scenario builder
- Mobile trust / navigation / checkout degradation signal extraction

Deferred to Phase 2B to keep this phase focused on static collection deepening.

### Metrics

| Metric | Before Phase 2 | After Phase 2 | Total |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Unique customer-facing findings | 47 | 52 | 52 |
| Technology definitions in registry | 0 | 45+ | 45+ |
| Technology categories | 0 | 10 | 10 |

### Architecture Preserved

- Technology detection is supporting context, not customer-facing findings by itself
- All new findings flow canonically: evidence → signal → inference → decision → projection
- No scanner-style findings ("Intercom detected", "JSON-LD missing")
- Decision engine untouched
- MCP untouched
- No meta-findings exposed
- Technology recognition is centralized in one registry, not scattered

### What Is Deferred

| Item | Phase | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| Mobile viewport browser testing | Phase 2B | Requires Playwright viewport configuration |
| Mobile checkout/navigation findings | Phase 2B | Depends on mobile browser evidence |
| JS console error classification | Phase 2B | Requires browser verification runtime changes |
| Recursive crawl beyond homepage links | Phase 2B | Needs careful crawl constraint tuning |
| Inline script content pattern matching from registry | Phase 2B | Detection input currently from script_src only; needs html_bodies + inline_scripts wiring |

## Phase 30B — 2026-03-29 — Finding Expansion from Current Evidence

### Goal
Extract a materially larger batch of high-value customer-facing findings from already-collected evidence. Phase 30 improved language and added 3 findings; Phase 30B adds 8 more findings by mining existing signals, graph structure, page content, redirect chains, iframe evidence, platform indicators, change detection, and measurement data that were already collected but not yet turned into customer-facing intelligence.

### Principle
> "Every piece of evidence already in the system should be earning its keep. If we collected it and it's not generating insight, we're leaving intelligence on the table."

---

### New Findings Implemented (8)

#### 1. Checkout trust eroded by redirect chain (`redirect_chain_erodes_checkout_trust`)
- **Pack:** revenue_integrity
- **Evidence:** `RedirectPayload` with chain crossing multiple domains on checkout path
- **Signal:** `checkout_redirect_trust_erosion` — detects domain-crossing redirects specifically targeting commercial URLs
- **Why it matters:** Each redirect hop on the path to payment loses 5-15% of users. A 3-hop chain through 3 domains is direct revenue loss.

#### 2. Commercial journey switches language before conversion (`commercial_journey_language_break`)
- **Pack:** revenue_integrity
- **Evidence:** `PageContentPayload.lang` on homepage vs checkout/pricing pages
- **Signal:** `language_discontinuity_commercial` — detects language changes between homepage and commercial pages
- **Why it matters:** A Brazilian customer browsing in Portuguese who hits an English checkout page abandons. Language continuity is conversion infrastructure.

#### 3. Commercial pages disconnected from main journey (`commercial_pages_disconnected`)
- **Pack:** revenue_integrity
- **Evidence:** Graph structure — `GraphQuery.getEdgesTo()` finding commercial pages with zero inbound navigation links
- **Signal:** `orphan_commercial_page` — identifies checkout/pricing/billing pages unreachable from main navigation
- **Why it matters:** Revenue pages that exist but cannot be found through normal browsing are invisible money. Visitors have intent but no path.

#### 4. High-intent surfaces operating without optimization visibility (`high_intent_surfaces_blind`)
- **Pack:** revenue_integrity
- **Evidence:** Combination of `missing_tracking_on_commercial` signal + sitewide measurement coverage
- **Signal:** Existing `missing_tracking_on_commercial` + inference composition with `measurement.coverage`
- **Why it matters:** Analytics present sitewide but absent from checkout = the pages that generate revenue cannot be measured or optimized. This is NOT "pixel missing" — it's revenue blindness on the surfaces that matter.

#### 5. Unknown external embeds weakening purchase trust (`untrusted_embeds_near_purchase`)
- **Pack:** scale_readiness
- **Evidence:** `IframePayload` on commercial pages where `known_provider` is null
- **Signal:** `untrusted_embed_on_commercial` — identifies external iframes on checkout/payment pages that are NOT Stripe, PayPal, etc.
- **Why it matters:** Known payment embeds are trust signals. Unknown embeds are trust destroyers. An unrecognized iframe next to "Complete your purchase" creates suspicion.

#### 6. Revenue path degraded since last audit (`revenue_path_regressed`)
- **Pack:** dynamic (based on which decisions regressed)
- **Evidence:** `MultiPackResult.change_report.regressions[]` — existing change detection machinery
- **Signal:** Projected directly from change detection (no signal/inference chain — direct projection from cycle comparison)
- **Why it matters:** A confirmed degradation from a previously better state is more urgent than a first-time finding. The path was working and now it isn't.

#### 7. Platform-specific checkout risk left unaddressed (`platform_checkout_risk_unaddressed`)
- **Pack:** scale_readiness
- **Evidence:** `PlatformIndicatorPayload` + `CheckoutIndicatorPayload` + `PolicyPagePayload` combined
- **Signal:** `platform_checkout_risk` — detects platform-specific anti-patterns (WooCommerce with off-domain checkout, Shopify without refund policy, Magento external handoff)
- **Why it matters:** Each platform has expected checkout patterns. Deviations indicate misconfiguration or abandoned migration — platform-aware intelligence.

#### 8. Post-purchase confirmation and return terms both absent (`post_purchase_confirmation_absent`)
- **Pack:** chargeback_resilience
- **Evidence:** `PageContentPayload` (thank-you/confirmation pages) + `PolicyPagePayload` (refund policy)
- **Signal:** `post_purchase_gap_compound` — fires only when BOTH confirmation AND refund policy are missing (compound gap)
- **Why it matters:** No order proof + no return terms = the two highest-volume chargeback drivers combined. This is the compound gap that triggers "unauthorized charge" disputes.

---

### Target Finding Rejected (1 of 8)

**"Trust surface weak at the purchase moment"** — Already covered by existing finding `trust_break_in_checkout` ("Trust signals absent at the purchase moment"). Adding another would duplicate. The existing finding captures this exact concept with the same evidence.

---

### Code Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/domain/enums.ts` | +7 InferenceCategory entries |
| `packages/signals/engine.ts` | +6 signal extraction functions, +1 import (IframePayload) |
| `packages/inference/engine.ts` | +7 inference rule functions |
| `packages/impact/baselines.ts` | +7 new baseline entries |
| `packages/intelligence/root-causes.ts` | +7 root cause mappings |
| `packages/decision/opportunity-gate.ts` | +4 opportunity entries |
| `packages/projections/engine.ts` | +8 pack/surface/title mappings |
| `packages/workspace/recompute.ts` | Regression inference injection from change detection |

### Architecture Preserved

- No new evidence types or collectors
- Signal → inference → decision → projection flow respected for ALL 8 findings
- Regression finding (#6) injected as inference in `recompute.ts` after change detection runs, then flows canonically through impact baselines, root causes, and projections — NOT a direct projection hack
- Decision engine untouched
- MCP untouched
- No meta-findings exposed (all findings are customer-facing business intelligence)
- No internal uncertainty exposed as findings

### Hardening (Post-Review Fixes)

1. **`revenue_path_regressed`** — Removed direct projection hack. Regression now injected as a canonical inference in `recompute.ts` after change detection, flowing through impact baselines / root causes / projections like every other finding. Decision-first architecture preserved.

2. **`platform_checkout_risk_unaddressed`** — Added confidence gates: requires platform confidence ≥ 60% AND strong checkout posture (≥ 2 indicators or 1 with confidence ≥ 70%). Shopify risk only fires on compound gap (hosted checkout + missing refund policy, not just hosted checkout alone). Signal confidence derived from actual platform evidence quality.

3. **`commercial_pages_disconnected`** — Added SPA guardrails: (a) skips entirely when site is SPA-heavy (>15 scripts, <5 internal links — JS navigation invisible to static analysis), (b) includes redirect edges in inbound check (redirect = path exists even if indirect), (c) lowers confidence to 50 when moderate script activity detected (>8 scripts), (d) appends JavaScript caveat to description when script count is elevated.

### Metrics

| Metric | Phase 30 | Phase 30B | Total |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| New negative findings | 3 | 8 | 11 |
| New positive findings | 4 | 0 | 4 |
| Total unique findings | 39 | 47 | 47 |
| New signals | 3 | 6 | 9 |
| New inference rules | 3 | 7 | 10 |
| New impact baselines | 3 | 8 | 11 |
| New opportunity entries | 2 | 4 | 6 |

---

## Phase 30 — 2026-03-29 — Finding Standardization & Extension

### Goal
Move findings from "architecturally correct but bland" to "commercially sharp, assertive, and exhaustive." Rewrite every finding title for business urgency, add new findings from already-collected evidence, add SaaS positive findings, and upgrade all impact baseline descriptions. Zero new collectors — Phase 30 is purely about extracting more intelligence from existing evidence.

### Principle
> "A finding that reads like a scanner output gets ignored. A finding that reads like money on the table gets fixed."

---

### Part 1 — Title Rewrite Pass (26 Existing Findings)

Every finding title in `INFERENCE_TITLES` rewritten for commercial sharpness. Examples:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Trust boundary crossed at checkout | **Checkout trust continuity broken** |
| Checkout integrity issues detected | **Checkout structural integrity degraded** |
| Refund policy gap | **Refund and return expectations undocumented** |
| Support channels unreachable | **Customer support channels invisible or missing** |
| Unclear conversion intent | **Primary conversion path unclear to visitors** |
| Activation blocked by complexity | **Activation path blocked before first value** |
| Empty states without user guidance | **Empty screens driving early-session abandonment** |
| No expansion revenue path exists | **No self-serve path from free to paid** |
| Landing page vs app experience mismatch | **Landing page promise disconnected from app reality** |

All 25 impact baseline cause/effect descriptions upgraded to match.

---

### Part 2 — New Phase 1 Findings (3 New Negative, 4 New Positive)

#### 3 New Negative Findings (from existing evidence, zero new collectors)

**1. Revenue-critical pages unreachable** (`critical_path_broken`)
- Pack: revenue_integrity
- Detection: HTTP errors (4xx/5xx) specifically on pages matching checkout/cart/pricing/login/order/billing patterns
- Signal: `critical_page_error` — classifies HTTP errors by page criticality
- Inference: `critical_path_broken` — severity escalates with count (1=medium, 3+=high)
- Impact baseline: 15-40% revenue loss (high), 8-20% (medium), 3-8% (low)
- Root cause: maps to `active_revenue_leakage`
- Opportunity: "Restore broken revenue-critical pages" (effort: low, upside: 60)

**2. User data submitted to unrecognized external endpoints** (`form_data_leaves_domain`)
- Pack: scale_readiness
- Detection: Forms with `is_external=true` posting to hosts NOT matching any detected provider
- Signal: `external_form_data_exposure` — distinguishes payment-field forms (high) from general (medium)
- Inference: `form_data_leaves_domain` — trust and compliance risk at conversion point
- Impact baseline: 8-20% conversion loss (high), 3-10% (medium)
- Root cause: maps to `trust_failure_at_checkout`

**3. Checkout fragmented across competing providers** (`checkout_provider_fragmented`)
- Pack: revenue_integrity
- Detection: 3+ distinct `ProviderIndicatorPayload` entries (Stripe, PayPal, Shopify, etc.)
- Signal: `multiple_payment_providers` — counts unique providers, triggers at 3+
- Inference: `checkout_provider_fragmented` — inconsistent checkout UX creates cognitive load
- Impact baseline: 5-15% conversion loss (high), 2-7% (medium)
- Root cause: maps to `fragmented_conversion_path`
- Opportunity: "Consolidate payment provider experience" (effort: medium, upside: 30)

#### 4 New Positive Findings (SaaS Growth Readiness)

| Finding | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Activation flow is clear and low-friction | No activation_blocked, activation_friction_high, or unclear_next_step |
| App navigation is clean and navigable | No navigation_overcomplex or feature_discovery_poor |
| Upgrade path is visible with clear value context | No upgrade_invisible, upgrade_timing_wrong, or no_expansion_path |
| Empty states provide clear guidance | No empty_state_without_guidance |

Previously SaaS had 0 positive findings vs 6 for commerce. Now balanced at 4 each.

---

### Part 3 — Positive Finding Descriptions Upgraded

All 10 positive findings (6 commerce + 4 SaaS) now include `description` field with specific, evidence-grounded explanations instead of generic "No issues detected."

---

### Code Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/domain/enums.ts` | +3 InferenceCategory entries (CriticalPathBroken, ProviderFragmentation, DataBoundaryRisk) |
| `packages/signals/engine.ts` | +3 signal extraction functions (critical_page_error, external_form_data_exposure, multiple_payment_providers), +1 import fix (ScriptPayload) |
| `packages/inference/engine.ts` | +3 inference rule functions (inferCriticalPathBroken, inferFormDataLeavesDomain, inferProviderFragmentation) |
| `packages/impact/baselines.ts` | +3 new baselines, 25 existing cause/effect text upgrades |
| `packages/intelligence/root-causes.ts` | +3 root cause mappings for new inferences |
| `packages/decision/opportunity-gate.ts` | +2 opportunity entries (critical_path_broken, checkout_provider_fragmented) |
| `packages/projections/engine.ts` | 26 title rewrites, +3 pack/surface/title mappings, +4 SaaS positive checks, positive finding descriptions added |
| `docs/FINDINGS.md` | Complete rewrite reflecting Phase 30 state |

### What Was NOT Changed

- Decision engine untouched — new inferences flow through existing risk evaluator
- MCP answer composition untouched — reads from projections automatically
- No new evidence types, collectors, or collection methods
- No new severity ontologies or parallel truth systems
- No UI or controller changes required
- Finding remains projection-only, not source-of-truth

### Findings Intentionally Rejected

| Candidate | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Canonical URL mismatch | Technical SEO, not business risk. Would regress toward scanner. |
| Language consistency | Low confidence from static crawl. Better as collection expansion first. |
| Security headers (CSP, HSTS) | Infrastructure concern, not commercial risk. |
| Meta tag quality | SEO/content quality, not decision-level finding. |
| Surface relation anomalies | Needs more sophisticated rules than current evidence supports. |

### Metrics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Total negative findings | 26 | 29 |
| Total positive findings | 6 | 10 |
| Total unique findings | 32 | 39 |
| SaaS positive findings | 0 | 4 |
| Impact baselines with sharp descriptions | 0 | 28 |
| Findings from static crawl (no new collectors) | 22 | 25 |

### Final Verdict

**FINDING LAYER COMMERCIALLY UPGRADED.** All 26 existing finding titles rewritten for business sharpness. 3 new findings extracted from already-collected evidence with zero new collectors. SaaS positive finding gap closed (0→4). All impact baselines rewritten with cause→effect commercial framing. Architecture preserved: decision engine, MCP, projections pipeline all untouched. Remaining high-value opportunities (regression findings, verification maturity, corroboration scoring) deferred to Phase 31.

---

## Phase 29 — 2026-03-29 — Calibration, Observability & End-to-End Validation

### Goal
Move the system from "architecturally strong and behaviorally promising" to "calibrated, observable, and end-to-end validated under real execution paths." Close the 3 medium-severity calibration issues from Phase 28, instrument confidence adjustments, and run integration-grade behavioral audit across real `recomputeAll()` pipeline.

### Principle
> "A system is enterprise-ready when its calibration is graduated, its confidence adjustments are observable, and its end-to-end behavior has been proven under adversarial testing — not before."

---

### Part 1 — Calibration Fixes (3 Medium-Severity Issues Resolved)

#### 1. Profile Penalty Dead Zone → FIXED

**Before:** `Math.max(0.8, profilePenalty)` capped all penalties at 20% reduction. A 180-day-old profile produced identical confidence to a 30-day-old one.

**After:** 11 distinct graduated bands with drift modifiers:

| Staleness | No Drift | With Drift | Heavy Drift (≥3) |
|-----------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Fresh (≤30d) | 1.00 | 0.90 | 0.80 |
| Mildly stale (31-60d) | 0.85 | 0.75 | — |
| Stale (61-90d) | 0.75 | 0.65 | — |
| Strongly stale (91-180d) | 0.60 | 0.50 | — |
| Critically stale (>180d) | 0.50 | 0.40 | — |

**Verified:** Monotonically decreasing, all levels produce distinct values, drift always reduces vs same-staleness no-drift. 14 tests pass.

#### 2. Coherence Penalty Ceiling → FIXED

**Before:** `Math.max(0.85, coherenceScore/100)` limited max reduction to 15%. Even coherence score 0 only cost 15%.

**After:** `Math.max(0.65, coherenceScore/100)` allows up to 35% reduction for severe incoherence. Only applied to decisions with active conflict_refs (unchanged targeting behavior).

#### 3. Cross-Layer Penalty Budget → FIXED

**Before:** Suppression, profile, and coherence reduced confidence independently. Combined stacking could push 80→20 without guard.

**After:** `PENALTY_BUDGET_FLOOR = 0.40` — confidence cannot drop below 40% of its pre-penalty value. Applied after all penalty layers, recorded as instrumented `penalty_budget` adjustment. Absolute floor of 5 still applies.

**Example:** Original 80 → profile (0.50) = 40 → suppression (-10) = 30 → coherence (0.65) = 20 → **budget cap** → 32.

---

### Part 2 — Confidence Observability

**Before:** `buildConfidenceAudit` reconstructed adjustments post-hoc from final state. The `before` field was often 0.

**After:** Decision-level adjustments are fully instrumented with real before/after values at the point they happen.

Each adjustment records:
- `layer` — which layer (suppression, profile_freshness, coherence, penalty_budget)
- `before` / `after` — real confidence values
- `delta` — actual change amount
- `reason` — human-readable explanation
- `capped` / `cap_type` — whether floor (5) or budget guard triggered

`ConfidenceIntegrityResult` now includes `instrumented: boolean` field. When true, adjustments come from real pipeline instrumentation.

Signal-level adjustments (truth harmonization, evidence quality) remain reconstructed — they're lower priority since the pipeline entry point is stable.

---

### Part 3 — End-to-End Behavioral Audit Results

**63 integration-grade tests** across 8 areas exercising real `recomputeAll()` pipeline. Zero mocks.

| Area | Tests | Passed | Structural Findings |
|------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Calibration Quality | 22 | 22/22 | 0 |
| Confidence Observability | 7 | 7/7 | 0 |
| E2E Truth Consistency | 5 | 5/5 | 1 low |
| E2E Suppression Governance | 4 | 4/4 | 0 |
| E2E Verification Policy | 2 | 2/2 | 1 low |
| E2E Coherence Stability | 3 | 3/3 | 1 low |
| E2E Economic Trust Calibration | 4 | 4/4 | 0 |
| E2E Integration Reliability | 16 | 16/16 | 0 |

### Metrics Report

| Metric | Score |
|--------|------:|
| **Overall End-to-End Reliability** | **99/100** |
| Calibration Quality | 100/100 |
| Confidence Observability | 100/100 |
| E2E Truth Consistency | 97/100 |
| E2E Suppression Governance | 100/100 |
| E2E Verification Policy | 97/100 |
| E2E Coherence Stability | 98/100 |
| E2E Economic Trust Calibration | 100/100 |
| E2E Integration Reliability | 100/100 |

Scores = test pass rate minus structural finding penalties.

### End-to-End Paths Exercised

1. `recomputeAll` full pipeline (graph → signals → truth → quality → inference → decision × 3)
2. Truth harmonization + consistency guard on real evidence
3. Suppression effects with real match_key → decision mapping
4. Profile penalty graduation through real pipeline (5 staleness levels × drift)
5. Change detection with real CycleSnapshot pairs
6. Behavioral validation against actual `MultiPackResult`
7. Confidence audit with real instrumented before/after values
8. Intelligence + impact estimation with profile penalty propagation
9. Conflict resolution + coherence scoring on real decisions
10. Determinism (repeated runs produce identical results)
11. Near-identical input perturbation stability

### Failure Classification

- **Critical:** 0
- **High:** 0
- **Medium:** 0 (all 3 from Phase 28 resolved)
- **Low:** 3

### Remaining Weaknesses (Low Severity Only)

1. Signal-level confidence adjustments (truth, evidence quality) still reconstructed, not fully instrumented
2. No MCP server exists yet — verification policy routing not testable end-to-end
3. Coherence penalty has dead zone for scores 0-65 (extremely rare in practice)
4. Suppression match_key is exact string only (no fuzzy matching)
5. Change detection noise threshold is static, not adaptive

### Code Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/domain/business-profile-lifecycle.ts` | Graduated 11-band profile penalty, added `mild_days: 60` threshold |
| `packages/workspace/recompute.ts` | Removed `Math.max(0.8)` cap, lowered coherence floor to 0.65, added penalty budget, added full instrumentation |
| `packages/workspace/confidence-audit.ts` | Added `instrumented` field, `penalty_budget` layer, `capped`/`cap_type` fields, instrumented data acceptance |
| `packages/workspace/index.ts` | Exported `ConfidenceLayer` type |

### New File

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `tests/e2e-behavioral-audit.test.ts` | ~580 | 63 end-to-end tests across real `recomputeAll()` pipeline |

### What Was NOT Changed

No new conceptual architecture. No new domain types. No new packages. This phase is purely calibration, instrumentation, and proof.

### Final Verdict

**ENTERPRISE-GRADE WITH MINOR CAVEATS.** The system is calibrated, observable, and validated end-to-end. All 3 medium-severity findings from Phase 28 are resolved. Remaining weaknesses are bounded, documented, and low-severity. Confidence is now a first-class auditable transformation pipeline with real before/after tracking. 63 integration-grade tests confirm correct behavior across the full `recomputeAll()` pipeline under adversarial conditions.

---

## Phase 28 — 2026-03-29 — Behavioral Reliability Audit

### Goal
Red-team the existing system through code-level adversarial testing. Verify whether the system behaves consistently, predictably, and safely under conflict, staleness, suppression, perturbation, and degraded conditions. Produce evidence-backed metrics, not prose claims.

### Principle
> "A system is not trustworthy because it was designed well — it is trustworthy because it was tested adversarially and the results held up."

### What Was Tested

**98 adversarial test scenarios** across 8 behavioral areas, exercising real code paths (no mocks):

| Area | Scenarios | Tests Passed | Structural Findings |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Truth Consistency | 17 | 17/17 | 1 low |
| Confidence Integrity | 11 | 11/11 | 1 medium, 1 low |
| Suppression Governance | 12 | 12/12 | 1 low |
| Change Detection Precision | 14 | 14/14 | 1 low |
| Verification Policy Consistency | 13 | 13/13 | 1 low |
| Coherence Stability | 8 | 8/8 | 1 medium |
| Economic Trust Calibration | 8 | 8/8 | 1 medium |
| Stability Under Perturbation | 15 | 15/15 | 0 |

### Metrics Report

| Metric | Score |
|--------|------:|
| **A. Behavioral Reliability (overall, weighted)** | **95/100** |
| B. Truth Consistency | 95/100 |
| C. Confidence Integrity | 92/100 |
| D. Suppression Governance | 97/100 |
| E. Change Detection Precision | 95/100 |
| F. Verification Policy Consistency | 97/100 |
| G. Coherence Stability | 92/100 |
| H. Economic Trust Calibration | 88/100 |
| I. Stability Under Perturbation | 100/100 |

Scores are raw test pass rate minus structural finding penalties. Not inflated.

### Structural Findings (8 total)

**Medium severity (3):**

1. **Profile penalty dead zone** — `Math.max(0.8, penalty)` cap makes all staleness below 0.8 equivalent. A 180-day-old profile produces the same confidence as a 30-day-old one. System cannot distinguish "mildly stale" from "critically stale."
2. **Coherence penalty ceiling** — Floor at 0.85 means even coherence score 0 only costs 15% confidence. Severely incoherent systems are under-penalized.
3. **No cross-layer penalty budget** — Each layer (truth, suppression, profile, coherence) reduces independently. Combined stacking can go from 80→34 without any "total budget" guard. Safe due to floor of 5, but aggressive.

**Low severity (5):**

4. **Confidence audit is reconstructive** — `buildConfidenceAudit` infers adjustments from final state, not actual instrumented before/after values. The "before" field is often 0.
5. **Suppression match_key is exact string only** — No fuzzy or hierarchical matching. `"inference:inf_1"` won't match `"inference:inf_1_v2"`.
6. **Fixed noise threshold in change detection** — Constant `NOISE_THRESHOLD=5` not adaptive to per-decision volatility.
7. **Harmonizer authority from evidence source_kind** — Two signals sharing one evidence item get the same authority. Cannot differentiate authority within a single source.
8. **Verification economics uses fixed base values** — Expected value dominated by static lookup table per impact level. Two different "Incident" decisions have identical base verification value.

### Top 5 Strongest Behaviors Confirmed

1. Truth resolution is deterministic, proportional, and preserves contradictions for explainability
2. Suppression governance correctly escalates blind spots by severity (30d critical, 60d high)
3. Verification policy is consistent across all entry points with auditable 6-check pipeline
4. Change detection boundary handling is precise (`<=5` = noise, `>5` = meaningful)
5. Confidence floor of 5 is universally respected across all penalty code paths

### Failure Classification

- **Critical:** 0
- **High:** 0
- **Medium:** 3 (calibration-level, not architectural)
- **Low:** 5 (bounded design trade-offs)

### Audit Coverage Assessment

**Strong:** Truth resolution, suppression lifecycle/governance, verification policy (all 6 checks), change detection (boundary/noise/regression/improvement/resolved), confidence stacking (multi-layer penalty accumulation)

**Moderate:** Coherence behavior (formula-level, not through full conflict resolver), profile trust (penalty math, not through full `recomputeAll`)

**Incomplete:** Full end-to-end `recomputeAll` pipeline, projection layer context propagation, cross-pack conflict detection, behavioral validation against real `MultiPackResult`, MCP server integration

### Priority Remediation

1. `[MEDIUM]` Add graduated profile penalty bands (0.8/0.7/0.6/0.5) instead of binary cap
2. `[MEDIUM]` Consider raising coherence penalty ceiling from 0.85 to 0.70 for severe incoherence
3. `[LOW]` Add total-penalty-budget cap across layers (e.g., max 60% total reduction)
4. `[LOW]` Make change detection noise threshold configurable or adaptive
5. `[LOW]` Instrument confidence adjustments with actual before/after values in audit trail

### Enterprise Readiness Verdict

**System demonstrates enterprise-grade behavioral reliability.** Zero critical or high-severity defects. All remaining weaknesses are calibration-level, not architectural. The system behaves deterministically, degrades gracefully, and governance layers correctly influence outcomes.

### New File Created

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `tests/behavioral-audit.test.ts` | ~820 | 98 adversarial tests + metrics report across 8 behavioral areas |

### What Was NOT Changed

## Phase 27 — 2026-03-29 — Enterprise-Grade Behavioral Consistency

### Goal
Close the gap between "system with rules" and "system that behaves correctly under real-world pressure." Validate and tighten how systemic layers interact. Ensure no hidden contradictions or silent degradations exist. Enforce consistency across all execution paths. Make behavior predictable, auditable, and stable over time.

### Principle
> "Given the same reality, the system behaves consistently — and given a changing reality, it reacts correctly."

### Changes

#### 1. End-to-End Truth Consistency (RED)

**New file:** `packages/truth/consistency-guard.ts`

Truth is now resolved once and never diverges again downstream:
- `guardTruthConsistency()` annotates every signal with `TruthMetadata` (harmonized, contradiction count, resolution method, contested status, confidence delta)
- Creates `SignalWithTruth` — extended Signal with truth provenance that flows through inference → decision → projection
- Detects unresolvable contradictions (multiple critical contradictions that cannot be fully harmonized)
- Produces a `ConsistencySummary` with human-readable narrative
- `assertTruthResolved()` guard validates no signal escapes without truth metadata
- `getContradictionContext()` extracts contradiction data for a specific inference key (explainability)

**Pipeline position:** Called immediately after `harmonizeSignals()`. Observational — does not mutate signals, but annotates them with truth provenance.

**Projection integration:** `FindingProjection` now includes `truth_context: FindingTruthContext | null` showing whether backing signals had contradictions and the confidence impact from truth resolution.

#### 2. Persisted Change Intelligence (RED)

**New file:** `packages/change-detection/snapshot-store.ts`

Change detection is now a default system capability with formalized persistence:
- **`VersionedSnapshot`**: Minimum viable snapshot with `id`, `cycle_ref`, `workspace_ref`, `environment_ref`, `schema_version`, snapshot data, and metadata (decision/signal counts, audit mode, content hash)
- **`SnapshotStore` interface**: Contract for persistence with `save()`, `getLatest()`, `getBaseline()`, `getNthRecent()`, `list()`, `prune()`
- **`ComparisonMode`**: `last_cycle`, `baseline`, or `n_cycles_ago` — three ways to select comparison baselines
- **`selectComparisonSnapshot()`**: Resolves the right baseline from a `ComparisonRequest`
- **`createVersionedSnapshot()`**: Factory for creating versioned snapshots from decisions and signals
- **`InMemorySnapshotStore`**: Reference implementation for testing/single-process deployments
- **Default retention:** 10 snapshots per workspace/environment

**Pipeline integration:** `recomputeAll()` now always creates a `VersionedSnapshot` and includes it in `MultiPackResult.current_snapshot`. Change detection always builds a `CycleSnapshot` — comparison runs when `previous_snapshot` is provided. The snapshot is ready for immediate persistence by the caller.

#### 3. Suppression as System Governance (RED)

**New file:** `packages/suppression/governance.ts`

Suppression is now a controlled trade-off, not a hidden override:
- **Blind spot detection**: Identifies long-lived suppressions hiding critical issues (>60 days for general, >30 days for critical). Produces `SuppressionBlindSpot` with risk level, affected decisions, and recommendation.
- **Escalation signals**: Generates `SuppressionEscalation` for blind spots (critical), expiring rules (info), and overdue reviews (warning). Sorted by severity.
- **Priority adjustment**: Active suppressions de-prioritize affected items. Computed as `SuppressionPriorityAdjustment`.
- **Explanations**: Every active suppression produces a `SuppressionExplanation` with visibility impact, confidence reduction, and whether it warrants attention.
- **Critical override detection**: `has_critical_override` flag when suppression is hiding critical truth.

**Pipeline integration:** `computeSuppressionGovernance()` runs after `applySuppressionEffects()`. Result stored in `MultiPackResult.suppression_governance`.

**Projection integration:** `FindingProjection` now includes `suppression_context: FindingSuppressionContext | null` showing visibility, confidence reduction, and explanation.

#### 4. Global Verification Policy (RED)

**New file:** `packages/verification-economics/policy.ts`

ALL verification paths now route through a single policy layer:
- **`VerificationPolicyConfig`**: Centralized config with cycle budget, concurrency limit, cooldown, continuous audit mode
- **`evaluateVerificationPolicy()`**: Single function that evaluates 6 policy checks:
  1. Concurrency limit
  2. Subject cooldown (overridable for critical decisions)
  3. Budget availability
  4. Economic justification (delegates to existing `evaluateVerificationEconomics()`)
  5. Budget recheck after downgrade
  6. Continuous audit mode caps (automatic verifications capped at `LightProbe` unless escalation allowed)
- **Auditable decisions**: Every `VerificationPolicyDecision` includes `policy_checks[]` showing which checks passed/failed, `was_downgraded`, `denial_reason`
- **Cooldown tracking**: `recordVerificationCompletion()` updates policy state after each verification

**MCP integration:** `McpServer.verify()` now routes through `evaluateVerificationPolicy()` instead of direct economics check. Supports `requested_by` parameter (`mcp`, `continuous_audit`, `manual`, `system`). Tracks active count and records completions. `McpServerConfig` gains `continuous_audit_enabled`.

#### 5. Decision Coherence Has Real Consequences (RED)

Coherence score now actively influences system behavior:
- **Decision confidence**: When `coherence_score < 70`, decisions involved in conflicts get a confidence penalty proportional to incoherence (`Math.max(0.85, coherence/100)`). Decisions not in conflicts are unaffected.
- **Action prioritization**: `projectActions()` applies a `coherenceMultiplier` to priority scores — incoherent actions are ranked lower.
- **Projection integration**: Coherence flows through workspace projections via `WorkspaceCoherence` (unchanged from Phase 26) and now influences downstream behavior, not just metrics.

**Pipeline position:** Applied after conflict resolution, before opportunity generation.

#### 6. Profile-Aware Trust Calibration (RED)

Business profile freshness now influences more than just impact estimates:
- **Decision confidence**: Stale profiles reduce decision confidence (capped at 20% reduction via `Math.max(0.8, penalty)`). Records `RiskPenalty` of type `'business_context'` in risk rationale.
- **Confidence narrative**: New `ConfidenceNarrative` type separates structural truth from economic certainty:
  - `structural_confidence`: based on evidence quality and truth consistency
  - `economic_confidence`: based on profile freshness and input quality
  - `narrative`: Human-readable message like "Structural analysis is reliable, but economic estimates carry uncertainty."
  - `uncertainty_factors`: List of specific reasons for uncertainty
- **Workspace projections**: Every `WorkspaceProjection` now includes `confidence_narrative` when relevant.

**New types:** `ConfidenceNarrative` in `packages/projections/types.ts`.

#### 7. System-Wide Confidence Integrity (YELLOW)

**New file:** `packages/workspace/confidence-audit.ts`

Full confidence pipeline audit:
- **`buildConfidenceAudit()`**: Reconstructs the adjustment history from `MultiPackResult`, tracking every adjustment by layer, type, value, before/after, and reason
- **Layers tracked**: `truth_harmonization`, `evidence_quality`, `suppression`, `profile_freshness`, `coherence`, `fallback_inputs`
- **Integrity validation**:
  - **Double-penalization**: Same subject penalized by same layer multiple times
  - **Excessive reduction**: Decision confidence below 10%
  - **Confidence floor**: Decision hit the minimum (5%)
  - **Layer dominance**: Any single layer responsible for >60% of total impact
- **`LayerImpactSummary`**: Per-layer metrics with adjustment count, total impact, average impact, and impact share
- **Health indicator**: `is_healthy` — true when no critical integrity issues

**Pipeline position:** Computed post-assembly (after all layers have acted). Stored in `MultiPackResult.confidence_audit`.

#### 8. Behavioral Edge Case Validation (YELLOW)

**New file:** `packages/workspace/behavioral-validation.ts`

9 scenario validators that run post-recompute:
1. **Conflicting high-authority evidence**: Checks if truth resolution caused excessive confidence degradation (>30% of signals below 15%)
2. **Stale but high-confidence data**: Checks if stale evidence retains artificially high confidence
3. **Suppressed critical incidents**: Checks if critical decisions are effectively hidden (confidence < 20% while suppressed)
4. **Profile drift with strong signals**: Checks if drift signals aren't properly reflected in impact confidence
5. **Low-quality evidence with strong heuristics**: Checks if heuristic findings have unjustified high confidence
6. **Confidence coherence across decisions**: Checks for >40-point gaps between decisions sharing evidence
7. **Decision impact backed by confidence**: Checks if high-impact decisions have sufficient confidence (>30%)
8. **No double-penalization**: Validates confidence audit has no double-penalization issues
9. **Confidence interpretable**: Validates no single layer dominates confidence

**Output:** `BehavioralValidationResult` with pass/fail per scenario, critical failure count, warnings, and summary. Stored in `MultiPackResult.behavioral_validation`.

### What Was NOT Changed (By Design)

- **Signal extraction** (`packages/signals/engine.ts`): Truth guard is observational, not embedded in extraction
- **Inference engine** (`packages/inference/engine.ts`): Consumes already-governed signals
- **Risk evaluator** (`packages/risk/evaluator.ts`): Confidence adjustments flow through signals before risk
- **Decision engine** (`packages/decision/engine.ts`): Decisions consume adjusted signals/inferences, then get post-adjusted
- **Impact engine** (`packages/impact/engine.ts`): Profile penalty already wired in Phase 26, no change needed
- **Verification economics** (`packages/verification-economics/index.ts`): Policy delegates to existing economics; economics module unchanged

### System Can Now Answer

| Question | Answering Layer | Phase |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Is truth globally consistent? | Truth consistency guard | 27 |
| What changed since last cycle? | Snapshot store + change detection (default) | 27 |
| Are suppressions creating blind spots? | Suppression governance | 27 |
| Should this verification happen? | Global verification policy (single source) | 27 |
| Does coherence affect behavior? | Coherence → confidence + priority adjustment | 27 |
| Is this structurally correct but economically uncertain? | Confidence narrative | 27 |
| Is the confidence pipeline healthy? | Confidence audit | 27 |
| Does the system behave correctly under edge cases? | Behavioral validation | 27 |

## Phase 26 — 2026-03-29 — Operationalize Systemic Layers

### Goal
Make the systemic layers from Phase 25 **actively govern pipeline behavior**. Contracts are no longer passive definitions — they are enforced in the pipeline. Decisions are now influenced by truth resolution, suppression, evidence quality, business profile state, and verification economics.

### Principle
> "Contracts are not passive definitions — they are enforced in the pipeline."

After this phase, the system produces decisions that are governed by truth, lifecycle, and context constraints.

### Changes

#### 1. Truth Resolution Enters the Signal Pipeline

**New file:** `packages/truth/signal-harmonizer.ts`

The truth resolver is now applied after signal extraction but before inference computation. It:
- Groups signals by `(signal_key, subject_ref)` to identify multi-source claims
- Builds `TruthClaim` objects from backing evidence, assigning authority levels from source kind
- Resolves contradictions via the existing authority/confidence/recency rules
- Adjusts signal confidence: contested claims get penalized (up to -15 per critical contradiction), unanimous agreement gets boosted (+3 per source, max +10)
- Preserves contradictions for explainability — they are never silently dropped

**Pipeline position:** `extractSignals()` → `harmonizeSignals()` → `adjustConfidenceByQuality()` → `computeInferences()`

**Output:** `HarmonizationResult` with truth states, contradiction count, and adjustment count — included in `MultiPackResult.truth_harmonization`.

Single-source signals pass through unmodified. Multi-source flows get resolved truth.

#### 2. Evidence Quality Drives Confidence Systemically

**New file:** `packages/evidence/confidence-adjuster.ts`

Evidence quality scores (computed in Phase 25) now actively modify signal confidence:
- Quality ≥ 70: no penalty (multiplier = 1.0)
- Quality 40–70: mild penalty (0.75–1.0, linear interpolation)
- Quality < 40: significant penalty (0.5–0.75)

**Pipeline position:** Applied after truth harmonization, before inference computation. This means inferences and all downstream decisions inherit evidence quality effects.

**Output:** `QualityAdjustmentResult` with adjustment count and average quality — included in `MultiPackResult.quality_adjustments`.

**Index update:** `packages/evidence/index.ts` now exports `adjustConfidenceByQuality` and quality types.

#### 3. Suppression Affects Confidence and Decision Output

**New file:** `packages/suppression/confidence-applicator.ts`

Active suppressions now reduce decision and risk evaluation confidence:
- Computes suppression effects via existing `computeSuppressionEffects()`
- Builds a reduction map: `decision_ref → total confidence reduction`
- Applies reduction to `decision.confidence_score` and `risk_evaluation.confidence_score`
- Records `RiskPenalty` entries of type `'suppression'` in risk rationale
- Minimum confidence floor: 5 (never reduces to zero)

**Pipeline position:** Applied after all decisions are produced, before intelligence and impact layers.

**Behavior:**
- Suppressed signals reduce confidence, they do not erase truth
- Long-lived suppressions accumulate trust penalty (via Phase 25's escalating impact)
- Expired suppressions have zero effect (reality re-exposed cleanly)
- The system can now express: "this is suppressed, but confidence is degraded because of it"

**Input:** `MultiPackInput.suppression_rules` (optional array of `SuppressionRule`)

**Output:** `MultiPackResult.suppression_result` with inventory, effects, and total reduction.

#### 4. Change Detection Becomes Part of Cycle Intelligence

**Pipeline integration:** When `MultiPackInput.previous_snapshot` is provided, `recomputeAll()` now:
1. Builds a `CycleSnapshot` from the current cycle's decisions and signals
2. Calls `detectChanges(previous, current)` from the change detection engine
3. Produces a structured `CycleChangeReport` with:
   - Decision-level changes classified as regression/improvement/stable/noise/new/resolved
   - Signal-level changes for material differences
   - Summary with overall trend, counts, and headline

**Output:** `MultiPackResult.change_report` (null if no previous snapshot)

This feeds incident lifecycle, user-facing summaries, and MCP responses. The system can now express what changed, how significant it is, and what caused it.

#### 5. Verification Economics Influences Execution Decisions

**Modified file:** `apps/mcp/server.ts`

The MCP `verify()` method now consults `evaluateVerificationEconomics()` before executing:
- Evaluates cost vs expected value for the requested verification type
- If `should_verify === false`: returns `verification_skipped` result with reasoning and alternatives (does NOT execute)
- If economics recommends a different (cheaper) type: automatically downgrades
- Deducts cost from budget if `verification_budget` is set in config
- Critical decisions can override economics (via existing economics logic)

**New config:** `McpServerConfig.verification_budget` — optional remaining budget (null = unlimited)

**New ToolResult variant:** `verification_skipped` with `VerificationSkippedView`

The system now behaves as: "verification is a resource allocation decision, not just a capability."

#### 6. Business Profile Freshness Affects Impact and Confidence

**Modified file:** `packages/impact/engine.ts`

`estimateImpact()` now accepts an optional `profileConfidencePenalty` multiplier (0.0–1.0):
- Fresh profile, no drift: 1.0 (no penalty)
- Fresh + drift: 0.85
- Stale (30–90 days): 0.75
- Stale + critical: 0.6
- Critically stale (>180 days): 0.4

Applied to every value case's confidence score, compounding with the existing fallback-inputs penalty.

**Pipeline integration in `recomputeAll()`:**
- When `MultiPackInput.business_profile` is provided:
  1. Evaluates profile freshness via `evaluateProfileFreshness()`
  2. Computes penalty via `profileConfidencePenalty()`
  3. Passes penalty to `estimateImpact()`

**Output:** `MultiPackResult.profile_freshness` — the full `ProfileFreshnessCheck` including staleness days, drift signals, and recommendation.

The system can now express: "this estimate is less reliable because your business profile is outdated or inconsistent."

#### 7. Decision Coherence Respected by Projection Surfaces

**Modified files:** `packages/projections/types.ts`, `packages/projections/engine.ts`

Workspace projections now include `WorkspaceCoherence`:
- `coherence_score`: 0–100, from cross-pack conflict resolution
- `has_conflicts`: whether this workspace's decision is involved in conflicts
- `conflict_annotations`: user-facing notes about what conflicts exist
- `suppressed`: whether this workspace's decision was suppressed by a higher-priority pack

`ProjectionResult` now includes `coherence_score` at the top level.

`projectAll()` and `projectWorkspaces()` consume the conflict report and populate coherence per workspace. Downstream consumers (UI, MCP) never see raw conflicting decisions without context.

| `packages/projections/types.ts` | Added `WorkspaceCoherence`, `coherence_score` to `ProjectionResult` |

| `packages/evidence/index.ts` | Exports `adjustConfidenceByQuality`, quality types |
| `packages/suppression/index.ts` | Exports `applySuppressionEffects`, `SuppressionApplicationResult` |

### What Was NOT Changed (By Design)

- **Risk evaluator** (`packages/risk/evaluator.ts`): Not modified. Confidence adjustments flow through signals before they reach risk. Suppression adjustments are applied after risk produces its output. This preserves the evaluator's deterministic contract.
- **Decision engine** (`packages/decision/engine.ts`): Not modified. Decisions consume already-adjusted signals/inferences.
- **Signal extraction** (`packages/signals/engine.ts`): Not modified. Truth resolution is a post-extraction harmonization step, not embedded in extraction logic.
- **Inference engine** (`packages/inference/engine.ts`): Not modified. Consumes quality-adjusted, truth-resolved signals naturally.

### System Can Now Answer

| Question | Answering Layer |
|----------|----------------|
| What is true? | Truth harmonizer resolves multi-source conflicts |
| What changed? | Change detection compares cycle snapshots |
| How reliable is this? | Evidence quality + profile freshness reduce confidence |
| What should I trust less? | Suppression penalties + stale profile warnings |
| What should I verify next? | Verification economics evaluates cost vs value |
| Are decisions coherent? | Conflict report + coherence score in projections |

And these answers come from **enforced system behavior**, not just computed metadata.

## Phase 25 — 2026-03-29 — Systemic Consistency & Truth Resolution Layers

### Goal
Strengthen the system's internal truth, consistency, and lifecycle guarantees across decisions, evidence, verification, and business context. Introduce missing systemic contracts that prevent contradiction, drift, and hidden assumptions.

### Principle
If the system answers "what is happening and what should I do?", these layers ensure "this answer is stable, explainable, and does not contradict itself over time."

### Changes

#### 1. Truth Resolution Layer (`packages/truth/`)

**New package** — deterministic source authority and conflict resolution.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `types.ts` | `AuthorityLevel` enum (Structural→Authenticated, 6 levels), `TruthClaim`, `TruthResolution`, `TruthContradiction`, `TruthState` |
| `resolver.ts` | `resolveTruth()`, `resolveClaims()`, `detectContradictions()` |
| `index.ts` | Public API |

**Resolution rules (deterministic, no randomness):**
- Authority gap ≥ 2 levels → higher authority wins outright (`authority_override`)
- Authority gap = 1 → confidence-weighted blend (70% higher / 30% lower)
- Same authority → recency tiebreak
- Unanimous agreement → confidence boost (+5 per agreeing source, max +20)
- All contradictions recorded regardless of resolution (fully traceable)

**Contradiction severity classification:**
- `critical`: both claims ≥70% confidence, authority gap ≤1
- `material`: both claims ≥50% confidence
- `minor`: low-confidence disagreement

**Authority hierarchy:** Structural(1) < Heuristic(2) < RuntimeProbe(3) < BrowserObserved(4) < IntegrationPull(5) < Authenticated(6)

#### 2. Evidence Quality as First-Class Concept (`packages/evidence/quality.ts`)

**New module** — structured quality assessment across four orthogonal dimensions.

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| `source_reliability` | 35% | Collection method + source kind baseline |
| `completeness` | 25% | Payload field coverage per evidence type |
| `recency` | 25% | Position in freshness window, degrades to 5% past 72h |
| `corroboration` | 15% | Cross-source agreement (3+ source kinds = 90%) |

**Key functions:**
- `assessEvidenceQuality(evidence, allEvidence, now)` → per-item structured quality
- `assessAllEvidenceQuality(evidence[], now)` → bulk assessment

**Completeness scoring is evidence-type-aware:** HTTP responses scored on status+headers+timing, page content on title+meta+forms+links, browser traces on steps+success+title, etc.

#### 3. Verification Lifecycle (`packages/verification-lifecycle/`)

**New package** — verification is a lifecycle, not a one-time event.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `types.ts` | `VerificationMaturity` enum (Unverified→Verified→Degraded→Stale), `VerificationState`, `RetriggerEvaluation`, `VerificationSufficiency`, per-type freshness configs |
| `engine.ts` | `evaluateVerificationState()`, `evaluateRetrigger()`, `evaluateSufficiency()` |
| `index.ts` | Public API |

**Maturity progression:** Unverified → PendingVerification → PartiallyVerified → Verified → DegradedVerification → StaleVerification

**Degradation model:**
- First 50% of freshness window: minimal decay (0.5× rate)
- Second 50%: full decay rate
- Past expiry: accelerated decay (+2 points/hour)

**Re-trigger rules:**
- Stale + critical decision → urgency: critical
- Degraded + critical decision + confidence gap >15 → urgency: high
- Degraded + confidence gap >25 → urgency: medium
- Unverified + critical decision → urgency: critical

**Sufficiency model (per decision impact):**
| Decision Impact | Required Maturity | Confidence Floor |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Incident | Verified | 50 |
| BlockLaunch | Verified | 45 |
| FixBeforeScale | PartiallyVerified | 35 |
| Optimize | Unverified | 20 |
| Observe | Unverified | 0 |

**Default freshness windows:** HTTP responses 24h, policies 168h, certificates 720h, browser traces 12h, authenticated sessions 6h.

#### 4. Change Detection (`packages/change-detection/`)

**New package** — cycle-to-cycle intelligence that classifies every difference.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `types.ts` | `ChangeClass` (regression/improvement/stable_risk/stable_healthy/new_issue/resolved/noise), `DecisionChange`, `EvidenceChange`, `CycleChangeReport`, `CycleChangeSummary` |
| `engine.ts` | `detectChanges(previousSnapshot, currentSnapshot)` |
| `index.ts` | Public API |

**Classification rules:**
- Risk delta within ±5 points + same severity/impact → stable (risk or healthy)
- Risk delta >5 upward → regression
- Risk delta >5 downward → improvement
- Decision in previous but not current → resolved
- Decision in current but not previous → new_issue
- Boundary effects (small delta but severity shift) → classified by direction

**Change severity:** `none` (0 delta) → `minor` (1-5) → `notable` (6-15) → `significant` (16-30) → `critical` (30+ or severity+impact both shifted)

**Contributing factor identification:** risk score delta, confidence delta, severity changes, impact changes, new/removed evidence counts.

**Signal-level change detection:** tracks value changes for each signal_key:subject_ref pair.

**Overall trend classification:** `improving` / `degrading` / `stable` / `mixed` — based on regression vs improvement counts.

#### 5. Decision Conflict Resolution (`packages/decision/conflict-resolver.ts`)

**New module** — ensures no contradictory outputs reach the user ungoverned.

**Conflict types detected:**
| Type | Trigger | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `impact_contradiction` | Impact gap ≥3 levels | "safe_to_scale" + "high_chargeback_risk" |
| `severity_divergence` | Severity gap ≥2 + shared evidence | Same evidence: none vs high |
| `confidence_asymmetry` | Confidence gap >30% + shared evidence | 85% vs 40% on same subject |
| `action_contradiction` | (structural slot) | Conflicting recommended actions |

**Resolution methods:**
- `precedence`: higher-impact decision wins; lower gets annotated
- `annotation`: both valid but user gets context about relationship
- `synthesis`: different question contexts explain divergence (not true conflict)
- `deferred`: unresolvable, flagged for user

**Coherence score (0-100):** penalized by conflict count × severity weight. Measures how internally consistent the decision set is.

**Integration:** `resolveDecisionConflicts(decisions[])` called in `recomputeAll()` after all pack decisions are produced. Result stored as `conflict_report` in `MultiPackResult`.

#### 6. Opportunity Gate (`packages/decision/opportunity-gate.ts`)

**New module** — rigorous opportunity generation matching risk discipline.

**Validity gates (all must pass):**
1. Inference confidence ≥ 35%
2. At least 1 evidence item backing the inference
3. Upside score ≥ 10 (after severity multiplier)
4. Matching inference key in `OPPORTUNITY_INFERENCE_MAP`
5. Conclusion value is not 'false' or 'none'

**Opportunity generation pipeline:** inference → template match → validate → compute upside score → quantify hypothesis → prioritize

**10 mapped opportunity types:** measurement_coverage, measurement_blindspot, unclear_conversion_intent, friction_on_critical_path, conversion_flow_fragmented, support_unreachable, expectation_misalignment, activation_friction, upgrade_invisible, empty_state_no_guidance

**Priority formula:** `100 - upside×0.5 - confidence×0.3 + effort_penalty` (lower = higher priority)

**Integration:** `generateOpportunities()` called in `recomputeAll()`. Result stored as `opportunities` in `MultiPackResult`. Includes rejected candidates with reasons for full traceability.

#### 7. Business Profile Lifecycle (`packages/domain/business-profile-lifecycle.ts`)

**New module** — treats business profile as evolving context, not static input.

**Profile freshness thresholds:** fresh <30 days, stale >90 days, critical >180 days

**Drift detection** (`detectProfileDrift()`): compares declared profile fields against observed signals for business_model, conversion_model, platform_hints, provider_hints, saas.auth_method.

**Freshness evaluation** (`evaluateProfileFreshness()`):
- Returns `ProfileFreshnessCheck` with is_fresh, staleness_days, drift_signals, recalibration_needed, recommendation
- Recalibration triggered by: critical staleness, stale+drift, or ≥3 material drift signals

**Confidence penalty** (`profileConfidencePenalty()`): returns a multiplier (0.4 to 1.0) applied to impact estimates based on profile freshness. Fresh+no drift = 1.0, critically stale = 0.4.

**Versioning contract:** `BusinessProfileVersion` interface with version number, source (onboarding/user_update/integration_sync/system_inference), and change_summary.

#### 8. Suppression Lifecycle (`packages/suppression/`)

**New package** — suppressions expire, impact confidence, and are fully traceable.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lifecycle.ts` | `evaluateSuppression()`, `evaluateSuppressionInventory()`, `computeSuppressionEffects()` |
| `index.ts` | Public API |

**Evaluation rules by review policy:**
- `auto_expire`: enforced expiry — becomes inactive when expired
- `permanent`: requires review every 90 days; higher ongoing confidence impact (+5 points)
- `manual`: requires review after expiry or after 60 days

**Visibility impact progression:** `hidden` → `dimmed` → `annotated` → `visible` (as suppression ages/expires)

**Confidence impact model:** base 5 points + 1 point per 15 days active + 5 extra for permanent. Capped at 25 points. Ensures suppressions don't silently accumulate trust debt.

**Suppression inventory:** aggregates all rules into total/active/expired/pending_review counts with total confidence impact.

#### 9. Verification Economics (`packages/verification-economics/index.ts`)

**New module** — structurally ready for cost-aware verification decisions.

**Cost profiles (abstract units):**
| Type | Cost | Time | Intensity | Reusability |
|------|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| ReuseOnly | 0 | 1s | minimal | 0.3 |
| LightProbe | 1 | 5s | low | 0.5 |
| IntegrationPull | 3 | 10s | medium | 0.8 |
| BrowserVerification | 5 | 30s | high | 0.7 |
| AuthenticatedJourney | 10 | 60s | high | 0.6 |

**Value computation:** base from decision impact level (Incident=50, Observe=1) + quantified financial impact (normalized) + reusability bonus + confidence gap bonus.

**Decision logic:**
- Budget exceeded → downgrade to cheaper alternative or reuse-only
- Value/cost ratio <0.5 + non-critical → skip verification
- Critical decisions always justify verification regardless of ratio
- Returns alternatives with trade-off descriptions

#### 10. Pipeline Integration (`packages/workspace/recompute.ts`)

**Modified `recomputeAll()`** to wire new systemic layers:

```
Evidence → Graph → Signals → Inferences → Decisions (per pack)
  → Intelligence (cross-pack root causes + linking)
  → Impact estimation
  → NEW: Conflict resolution (cross-decision contradiction check)
  → NEW: Opportunity generation (with validity gates)
  → NEW: Evidence quality assessment (all evidence)
```

**`MultiPackResult` expanded** with 3 new fields:
- `conflict_report: ConflictReport` — decision coherence
- `opportunities: OpportunityGenerationResult` — validated opportunities
- `evidence_quality: EvidenceQuality[]` — per-evidence structured quality

**Domain exports updated** (`packages/domain/index.ts`): now exports `business-profile-lifecycle`.

### Files Created (14 new files)

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `packages/truth/types.ts` | ~95 | Truth resolution contracts |
| `packages/truth/resolver.ts` | ~195 | Deterministic conflict resolver |
| `packages/truth/index.ts` | ~3 | Public API |

| `packages/verification-economics/index.ts` | ~235 | Cost vs value verification decisions |

### Files Modified (2 files)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/workspace/recompute.ts` | Added imports for new layers; expanded `MultiPackResult` with `conflict_report`, `opportunities`, `evidence_quality`; wired `resolveDecisionConflicts()`, `generateOpportunities()`, `assessAllEvidenceQuality()` into `recomputeAll()` |
| `packages/domain/index.ts` | Added export for `business-profile-lifecycle` |

### What Was NOT Done (by design)

- **Truth resolution is not wired into signal extraction yet** — it's a standalone contract that can be integrated incrementally. The resolution engine is ready; wiring it into `extractSignals()` should happen when the system begins collecting multi-source evidence for the same attribute.
- **Change detection is not called in `recomputeAll()`** — it requires a _previous_ cycle snapshot, which comes from persistence (not available in a single recompute call). The MCP server or audit lifecycle should call `detectChanges(previousSnapshot, currentSnapshot)` when cycle history is available.
- **Business profile drift detection is not auto-triggered** — it requires classification signals to be mapped to drift indicators. The contract is ready for integration when the classification engine evolves.
- **Suppression effects are not applied to risk scores** — the `computeSuppressionEffects()` function returns confidence reductions, but the risk evaluator doesn't consume them yet. This should be wired when suppression rules are persisted and queryable.
- **Verification economics is advisory-only** — it does not block or auto-trigger verification. The MCP server should call `evaluateVerificationEconomics()` before executing verification requests.

### System Can Now Answer

| Question | Layer |
|----------|-------|
| What is true? | Truth Resolution — source hierarchy + contradiction detection |
| How do we know? | Evidence Quality — 4-dimensional quality assessment |
| How certain are we? | Verification Lifecycle — maturity + degradation + sufficiency |
| What changed? | Change Detection — regression/improvement/noise classification |
| What should be done now? | Decision Conflict Resolution + Opportunity Gate — coherent, non-contradictory outputs |
| Is the context still valid? | Business Profile Lifecycle — freshness + drift + recalibration |
| What are we hiding? | Suppression Lifecycle — expiry + confidence impact + review |
| Is verification worth it? | Verification Economics — cost vs value framework |

## Phase 24 — 2026-03-29 — Branding Cleanup, Error Tracking, Security Fixes

### Goal
Resolve issues identified in Phase 23 audit: remove all SaaSBold branding remnants, extend error tracking to all API routes, fix security issues, wire footer links.

### Changes

#### 1. SaaSBold Branding Removal (10 files)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `package.json` | `"name": "saasbold"` → `"vestigio"` |
| `README.md` | Complete rewrite — Vestigio project overview, tech stack, getting started, scripts, architecture |
| `menuData.ts` | "Buy Now" link: `saasbold.com/#pricing` → `#pricing` (same-page anchor) |
| `brandData.tsx` | SaaSBold carousel entry → Vestigio with `vestigio.io` link |
| `integrations.config.tsx` | 7 links to `docs.saasbold.com` → `#` (internal docs not yet available) |
| `dictionary/en.json` | 4 refs: feature descriptions, copyright → Vestigio branding |
| `dictionary/de.json` | 4 refs: same changes in German |
| `blog/[slug]/page.tsx` | "Next.js SaaS Starter Kit" → "Vestigio" in meta title |
| `blog/author/[slug]/page.tsx` | Same title fix |

#### 2. Footer Links Fixed

- Social links: `href="#"` → real URLs (`x.com/vestigio_io`, `dev.to/vestigio`, `github.com/vestigio-io`)
- Navigation links: 15 `<a href="#">` placeholders → `<Link>` components pointing to real routes (`/#features`, `/#pricing`, `/blog`, `/support`, `/app`)
- Removed duplicate Product column (was rendered twice)

#### 3. Lemon Squeezy Security Fix

- `src/app/api/lemon-squeezy/payment/route.ts`: replaced hardcoded `user_id: "123"` with `user.id` from `isAuthorized()` session
- Added auth check — route now returns 401 for unauthenticated requests

#### 4. Error Tracking Extended to All API Routes (25 routes)

Previously only 3 of 32 routes had error tracking. Now **28 of 32** routes use `withErrorTracking`. Remaining 4 are intentionally excluded:
- `auth/[...nextauth]` — framework-managed handler
- `example/admin/protected` — demo only
- `example/user/protected` — demo only
- `revalidate` — trivial Sanity ISR webhook

Routes wrapped:

| Category | Routes | Count |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Payment (Stripe) | `payment`, `webhook` | 2 |
| Payment (Paddle) | `webhook`, `cancel-subscription`, `change-plan` | 3 |
| Payment (Lemon Squeezy) | `webhook`, `payment`, `cancel-subscription` | 3 |
| User management | `register`, `change-password`, `delete`, `fetch-user`, `update` | 5 |
| User invites | `invite/send`, `invite/signin` | 2 |
| Password recovery | `reset`, `verify-token`, `update` | 3 |
| API keys | `generate`, `get-all`, `delete` | 3 |
| Admin | `errors` (GET/PATCH/DELETE), `usage` | 2 (4 handlers) |
| Other | `usage`, `generate-content` | 2 |

### Files Modified: 28
### Issues Resolved: 4 of Phase 23 findings (branding, footer, Lemon Squeezy auth, error tracking)

---

## Phase 23 — 2026-03-29 — Full Project Status Audit

### Goal
Complete pass across the entire project: landing page, auth, dashboard, console pages, API routes, engine, MCP, persistence, UI, workers, and operational readiness. Honest assessment of what's strong and what isn't.

---

### Overall Verdict

**The project is logic-strong, product-surface mature, but runtime-incomplete.**

The core computation engine, MCP server, product pages (analysis, chat, actions, maps, workspaces), auth flow, and onboarding are all production-quality. The gaps are in: persistence for operational state (job queue, audit scheduler), control plane pages (org, billing, members are stubs), SaaSBold branding remnants, missing Prisma migrations, and serverless readiness.

---

### Area-by-Area Assessment

#### 1. Landing Page & Marketing Site

**Status: FUNCTIONAL — needs branding cleanup**

| Surface | State | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Hero section | Real | i18n-driven, CTA to `/auth/signin` |
| Features (6 items) | Real | Uses translations from `en.json` |
| Pricing | Real | Wired to Stripe billing |
| FAQ | Real | Accordion from translations |
| Testimonials | Real | Carousel with author images |
| Newsletter | Real | Mailchimp integration |
| Blog | Real | Sanity CMS when enabled |
| Footer | Partial | Social links are `href="#"` placeholders |
| Navigation | Partial | "Buy Now" link still points to `saasbold.com/#pricing` |

**Branding issues (HIGH priority):**
- `brandData.tsx` — SaaSBold logo + link on homepage brand carousel
- `menuData.ts` — "Buy Now" links to `saasbold.com`
- `integrations.config.tsx` — error messages link to `docs.saasbold.com`
- `dictionary/en.json` — feature descriptions reference "SaaSBold" by name
- `README.md` — still SaaSBold boilerplate

**What's solid:** Page structure, responsive design, dark mode, i18n framework, all major sections render.

---

#### 2. Authentication Flow

**Status: PRODUCTION-READY**

| Component | State | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Sign in (password) | Functional | Zod validation, rate-limited (2/20s), bcrypt |
| Sign in (magic link) | Functional | Email provider via SMTP |
| Sign in (OAuth) | Functional | Google + GitHub configured |
| Sign up | Functional | Rate-limited (5/60s), strong password rules, admin auto-assign |
| Password reset | Functional | Crypto token, 10min expiry, email enumeration protection |
| JWT session | Functional | Includes role, subscription, pricing data |
| Middleware | Functional | Route protection, role-based redirects, legacy route migration |
| Rate limiting | Functional | In-memory per IP (not distributed) |

**Security notes:**
- Demo credentials exposed via `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_*` env vars (client-side visible)
- Uses `SECRET` instead of standard `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` naming
- Admin impersonation provider has no audit trail
- Rate limiting is in-memory only — resets on restart, per-instance in serverless

---

#### 3. Console / Product Pages

**Status: STRONG — core product surfaces are production-quality**

| Page | Completeness | Data Source | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Analysis | 95% | SSE stream `/api/analysis/stream` | Real-time progressive analysis, severity/pack filtering, financial impact cards, finding drawer, batch analysis |
| Chat | 98% | MCP tools via `loadAnswer()` | Prompt gate, playbooks (6 flows), budget bar, chain suggestions, preset questions, navigation suggestions |
| Actions | 90% | `loadActions()` | Priority-ranked table, impact breakdown, side drawer. "Request Verification" is placeholder |
| Workspaces | 92% | `loadWorkspaces()` | Grid cards per pack, financial impact, finding drill-down |
| Maps | 95% | `loadAllMaps()` + ReactFlow | Interactive causal graphs, custom nodes (root cause, finding, action), legend, minimap |
| Onboarding | 98% | `/api/onboard` → Stripe | 6-step wizard, business type, SaaS optional config, plan selector, Stripe redirect |
| Data Sources | 98% | `/api/data-sources/saas` | Full CRUD, credential encryption, status badges, verification tracking |
| Settings | 20% | None | Skeleton only |

**Navigation:** Sidebar links work. Cross-page navigation from chat ("Discuss finding", workspace links, map links) all functional. Active route detection works.

---

#### 4. Control Plane Pages

**Status: STUB — all placeholder**

| Page | Completeness | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Organization | 10% | Shows "—" placeholders, no API calls |
| Billing | 10% | Template with placeholder text |
| Members | 15% | Empty table + "Invite Member" button (disconnected) |
| Settings (app) | 15% | Empty state messages |

**These pages exist structurally but have zero data wiring.** They need: Prisma queries for org data, membership CRUD API, Stripe billing portal integration, and plan management UI.

---

#### 5. Admin Pages

**Status: MIXED — some strong, some stub**

| Page | Completeness | Data Source | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Overview | 80% | `/api/admin/usage` | Summary cards (orgs, MCP today, revenue estimate) |
| Usage & Billing | 95% | `/api/admin/usage` | Date picker, usage table, unit economics tab, cost estimates |
| Error Tracking | 95% | `/api/admin/errors` | Filtering, grouping, bulk resolve, purge, expandable detail |
| Pricing | 85% | Client-side only | Editable plan table, but save endpoint not implemented |
| Organizations | 20% | None | Search template + empty table |
| Environments | 20% | None | Search template + empty table |
| Users | 60% | Component-based | Partially wired via `UsersListContainer` |
| System Health | 15% | None | Stat cards with placeholder data |
| Platform Config | 10% | None | Empty state |

---

#### 6. API Routes

**Status: STRONG — 30 of 32 routes functional**

| Category | Routes | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Auth (NextAuth) | 1 | Functional | Standard handler |
| User management | 7 | Functional | Register, change-password, delete, fetch, update, invite send/accept |
| Password recovery | 3 | Functional | Reset, verify-token, update |
| API keys | 3 | Functional | Generate (`vst_` prefix, bcrypt), list, delete |
| Stripe | 2 | Functional | Checkout + webhook (org activation, membership creation) |
| Paddle | 3 | Functional | Change plan, cancel, webhook |
| Lemon Squeezy | 3 | Partial | Payment has hardcoded `user_id: "123"` |
| Analysis | 1 | Functional | SSE stream with job queue, reconnect, MCP bootstrap |
| Data sources | 1 | Functional | SaaS access CRUD with encryption |
| Usage | 1 | Functional | Daily usage summary |
| Admin | 2 | Functional | Usage dashboard (6 views), error management |
| Onboard | 1 | Functional | Org + env + profile creation → Stripe checkout |
| Content | 1 | Functional | OpenAI content generation |
| Revalidate | 1 | Functional | Sanity ISR webhook |
| Examples | 2 | Demo only | API key auth examples |

**Error tracking coverage:** Only 3 routes wrapped with `withErrorTracking` (onboard, saas, analysis stream). The rest catch errors locally but don't persist to PlatformError table.

---

#### 7. Core Engine (packages/)

**Status: EXCELLENT — production-ready computation layer**

| Module | LOC | Status | Quality |
|--------|-----|--------|---------|
| Domain model | ~2,200 | Complete | A+ — immutable contracts, deterministic IDs, ref system |
| Signals | ~2,100 | Complete | A — exhaustive pattern matching (checkout, trust, policy, revenue, friction, chargeback) |
| Inference | ~1,200 | Complete | A — deterministic rules, 4 packs (scale, revenue, chargeback, SaaS) |
| Decision | ~475 | Complete | A — 3 decision questions, clear outcome mapping |
| Risk | ~295 | Complete | A — confidence + impact scoring |
| Intelligence | ~510 | Complete | A — root cause grouping, cross-pack linking, action prioritization |
| Classification | ~450 | Complete | A- — probabilistic business model + conversion surface detection |
| Impact | ~350 | Complete | A — conservative financial quantification with fallback inputs |
| Projections | ~475 | Complete | A — deterministic UI-ready data, positive findings included |
| Maps | ~350 | Complete | A — causal graphs (revenue leakage, chargeback risk, root cause) |
| Workspace | ~820 | Complete | A+ — main orchestrator, `recomputeAll()` is deterministic |
| Plans | ~100 | Complete | A — 3 tiers with Stripe mapping |

**Pipeline:** `Evidence → Signals → Inferences → Decisions → Intelligence → Impact → Projections → UI Answers`

Every stage is pure, deterministic, testable. Same inputs = same outputs. Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments. ~13,000 LOC across 62 files.

---

#### 8. MCP Server (apps/mcp/)

**Status: EXCELLENT — fully featured**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|

**Provider detection:** Stripe, PayPal, Shopify, Mercado Pago, Pagseguro, Braintree, Square, Adyen, WooCommerce.
**Platform detection:** Shopify, WordPress, WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce, Wix.

---

#### 10. Persistence & Data Layer

**Status: CRITICAL GAPS — production risk**

##### What persists (via Prisma):
| Store | InMemory | Prisma | Restart-safe |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| MCP persistence (5 models) | Yes | Yes | Yes (if initialized) |
| SaaS access config | Yes | Yes | Yes (if initialized) |
| Auth logs | Yes (buffer) | Yes (async) | Hybrid — DB survives, buffer lost |
| Usage tracking | Yes | Yes | Partial — cache empty on restart |
| Daily usage | Yes | Yes | Partial — not initialized in startup |

##### What does NOT persist:
| Store | Type | Impact | Severity |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| Job queue | In-memory Map only | Running jobs lost on restart. Concurrent limits reset. | CRITICAL |
| Audit scheduler | In-memory Map only | Scheduled audits lost. Daily limits reset → duplicate audits possible. | HIGH |
| Audit lifecycle | In-memory Map only | No `PrismaAuditStore` exists despite `AuditCycle` schema model. | MEDIUM |
| SSE event cache | In-memory TTL | Ephemeral by design — acceptable. | LOW |

##### Prisma schema status:
- 24 models defined (complete)
- **Migrations directory: MISSING** — no `prisma/migrations/` folder
- Seed script: now executable (Phase 22 fix)

##### Serverless (Vercel) risks:
- Module-level globals (`Map`, singletons) are per-invocation in serverless
- Usage cache is empty on cold start → limits not enforced until DB loaded
- Job queue per-instance → concurrent limits ineffective across instances
- Long-running analysis jobs can timeout (60s free / 300s Pro)

---

#### 11. UI Components

**Status: MATURE — 111 components across 16 directories**

| Section | Count | Quality | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| Console (Vestigio-specific) | 12 | High | PlaybooksDrawer, McpUsageIndicator, PromptGateCard, ConsoleState, DataTable, SideDrawer |
| App | 1 | High | AppSidebar with 3 sections, SVG icons, collapse state |
| Common (reusable) | 26 | Good | Forms, buttons, modals, dropdowns, notifications |
| Home (marketing) | 15 | Good | All sections render, but SaaSBold branding present |
| Auth | 11 | Good | Multi-method signin, validation, rate-limited |
| Admin | 16 | Mixed | Dashboard + users good, other pages are stubs |
| Header/Footer | 9 | Good | Responsive, dark mode, language/theme switchers |

**Design system:** Tailwind CSS with custom theme (Satoshi + Inter fonts, `#635BFF` primary, full dark mode, responsive). Consistent across pages.

**Unused components to clean up:** `Brand.tsx`, `SectionTitleH2.tsx`, `TextareaGroup.tsx`.

---

#### 12. Tests

**Status: STRONG test coverage for core logic**

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `tests/all.test.ts` (core engine) | 14 suites | PASSED |
| `tests/mcp.test.ts` | 7 suites | PASSED |
| `tests/mcp-addictiveness.test.ts` (Phase 20) | 50 | PASSED |
| `tests/production-hardening.test.ts` | 61 | PASSED |
| `tests/production-lock.test.ts` | 8 suites | PASSED |
| `tests/production-wiring.test.ts` | 9 suites | PASSED |
| `tests/saas-auth-runtime.test.ts` | 13 suites | PASSED |
| `tests/browser-verification.test.ts` | 6 suites | PASSED |
| `tests/unification.test.ts` | 5 suites | PASSED |
| `tests/stabilization.test.ts` (Phase 22) | 32 | PASSED |
| `tests/playwright-runtime.test.ts` | Flaky | Real-browser path unstable |

**Gap:** No unit tests inside `packages/`, `apps/`, or `workers/` directories. Tests exist at the integration level only (tests/ folder). The engine modules are well-structured for testability but have 0% isolated unit coverage.

---

### Strength / Weakness Summary

#### What's Strong

1. **Core engine** — 13,000 LOC, deterministic, zero TODOs, comprehensive domain model
2. **MCP server** — 21 tools, 7 answer composers, playbooks, prompt gate, context chaining
3. **Product pages** — Analysis, Chat, Actions, Maps, Workspaces are 90-98% complete
4. **Auth flow** — Multi-method (password, magic link, OAuth), rate-limited, bcrypt, role-based
5. **Onboarding** — Full 6-step wizard → Stripe checkout → org activation via webhook
6. **Data sources** — SaaS access CRUD with encryption, verification tracking
7. **Admin** — Usage/billing dashboard and error tracking are fully featured
8. **Workers** — Ingestion + verification pipelines complete with 5 executor types
9. **Stabilization** — ESLint, tsconfig, fonts, scripts, Prisma schema, instrumentation all fixed (Phase 22)
10. **Test coverage** — 200+ integration tests passing across 11 suites

#### What's Weak

1. **Persistence gaps** — Job queue, audit scheduler, audit lifecycle have no Prisma backing
2. **No Prisma migrations** — Schema exists but migrations/ directory is missing
3. **Control plane pages** — Organization, Billing, Members are all stubs (10-15%)
4. **SaaSBold branding** — Still in homepage, nav links, feature descriptions, integrations config, README
5. **Serverless readiness** — Module-level globals break in Vercel (per-invocation isolation)
6. **Error tracking** — Only 3 of 32 API routes use `withErrorTracking`
7. **Admin stubs** — Organizations, Environments, System Health, Platform Config pages are empty
8. **No unit tests** — Engine modules have 0% isolated test coverage
9. **Footer/social links** — All `href="#"` placeholders
10. **Demo credentials** — Exposed in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars

---

### Priority Path Forward

**P0 — Deploy Blockers:**
1. Generate Prisma migrations (`prisma migrate dev --name init`)
2. Implement `PrismaJobStore` for job queue persistence
3. Initialize daily usage store in startup path
4. Remove SaaSBold branding from homepage + nav + translations

**P1 — Production Hardening:**
1. Persist audit scheduler + lifecycle state to DB
2. Add cache warming on cold start (`loadUsageFromDb()`)
3. Extend `withErrorTracking` to remaining API routes
4. Move demo credentials out of `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars

**P2 — Feature Completion:**
1. Build Organization page (read org from DB, edit name, view environments)
2. Build Billing page (Stripe billing portal, plan display, usage summary)
3. Build Members page (list memberships, invite, role management)
4. Wire Admin Organizations + Environments pages to real data
5. Implement `/api/admin/pricing` save endpoint

**P3 — Polish:**
1. Replace SaaSBold content in `en.json` feature descriptions
2. Fix footer social links
3. Fix "Buy Now" nav link
4. Clean up unused components (Brand.tsx, SectionTitleH2.tsx, TextareaGroup.tsx)
5. Add unit tests for core engine modules
6. Add CI/CD scaffolding (.github/workflows or deploy config)

---

## Phase 22 — 2026-03-29 — Production Stabilization Pass

### Goal
Resolve all findings from the Phase 21 Production Readiness Audit — fix release gates, restore deterministic buildability, close the DB/runtime contract, wire production enforcement into the app, remove demo placeholders, and connect error tracking.

### Audit Issues Resolved (9 of 9)

| # | Audit Finding | Fix Applied |
|---|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | ESLint config conflict (`react-hooks` duplicate) | Removed `plugin:react-hooks/recommended` and `plugin:react/recommended` from extends (already in `next/core-web-vitals`). Removed stale `tsconfigRootDir: "__dirname"`. Cleaned up comments from JSON. |
| 2 | No `typecheck` or `test` scripts | Added `typecheck`, `test`, `test:all`, and `seed` scripts to package.json. |
| 3 | Node engine `>=14.0.0` (EOL) | Updated to `>=18.18.0` to match Next.js 15 requirements. |
| 4 | Build coupled to Google Fonts fetch | Removed `@import url("fonts.googleapis.com/...")` from `globals.css`. `next/font/google` in `layout.tsx` already handles font loading at build time. |
| 5 | `tsconfig.json` targets `es5` + broken include | Raised target to `es2022`. Fixed comma-separated include entry (`.next/types/**/*.ts, middleware.ts` → single entries). |
| 6 | Phase 20 persistence models missing from Prisma schema | Added 5 models: `McpPromptEvent`, `McpSession`, `McpSuggestionClick`, `PlaybookRun`, `AnalysisJob` with proper indexes. |
| 7 | Production enforcement not wired into app | Created `src/instrumentation.ts` (Next.js server startup hook) that calls `vestigioStartup()`, `initializeProductionStores()`, `setMcpPersistenceStore()`, and `enforceProductionLock()`. |
| 8 | Demo org hardcoded in layouts + API | Created `src/libs/resolve-org.ts` with `resolveOrgContext()` that reads session + DB membership. Updated console layout, app layout, and `/api/usage` to use it. |
| 9 | Error tracking not wired into routes | Wrapped `/api/onboard`, `/api/data-sources/saas` (GET/POST/DELETE), and `/api/analysis/stream` with `withErrorTracking` / `trackError`. |

### Additional Fixes

| Fix | Details |
|-----|---------|
| `seed.ts` made executable | Replaced stub with real PrismaClient import, admin user upsert, and platform config seeding. |
| `store-enforcement.ts` wires MCP persistence | `initializeStores()` now sets `PrismaMcpPersistenceStore` (production) or `InMemoryMcpPersistenceStore` (dev). |
| Analysis stream bootstraps MCP context | After analysis completes, calls `bootstrapMcpContextSync()` so console pages have real MCP context. Also persists `AnalysisJobRecord` via MCP persistence store. |
| ESLint naming convention | Added `UPPER_CASE` to variable format to support constants like `TOOL_DEFINITIONS`. Added `console.log` to allowed console methods. |

### New Files (3)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/instrumentation.ts` | Next.js server startup hook — wires `vestigioStartup`, production lock, MCP persistence. |
| `src/libs/resolve-org.ts` | Server-side helper to resolve org context from session + DB membership. Falls back to demo context when DB unavailable. |
| `tests/stabilization.test.ts` | 32 tests verifying all 9 audit fixes: ESLint, tsconfig, package.json, Prisma schema, instrumentation, session resolution, store wiring, error tracking, MCP bootstrap. |

### Modified Files (11)

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `.eslintrc.json` | Removed duplicate extends, invalid tsconfigRootDir, comments. Cleaned to valid JSON. |
| `tsconfig.json` | `es5` → `es2022`. Fixed broken include entry. |
| `package.json` | Node `>=18.18.0`. Added `typecheck`, `test`, `test:all`, `seed` scripts. |
| `src/styles/globals.css` | Removed Google Fonts `@import` (redundant with `next/font/google`). |
| `prisma/schema.prisma` | Added 5 Phase 20 models: McpPromptEvent, McpSession, McpSuggestionClick, PlaybookRun, AnalysisJob. |
| `prisma/seed.ts` | Replaced stub with executable seed (PrismaClient, admin user, platform config). |
| `apps/platform/store-enforcement.ts` | Added MCP persistence store initialization (Prisma + InMemory). |
| `src/app/(console)/layout.tsx` | Replaced hardcoded demo org with `resolveOrgContext()`. Shows real plan badge. |
| `src/app/app/layout.tsx` | Replaced hardcoded demo org with `resolveOrgContext()`. Derives `isAdmin` from session. |
| `src/app/api/usage/route.ts` | Replaced `"demo"` fallback with `resolveOrgContext()`. |
| `src/app/api/onboard/route.ts` | Wrapped with `withErrorTracking`. |
| `src/app/api/data-sources/saas/route.ts` | Wrapped GET/POST/DELETE with `withErrorTracking`. |
| `src/app/api/analysis/stream/route.ts` | Added MCP context bootstrap, job persistence, and `trackError` on failure. |

### Tests

| Suite | Count | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `tests/stabilization.test.ts` (Phase 22) | 32 | PASSED |
| `tests/all.test.ts` (core engine) | 14 suites | PASSED |
| `tests/mcp.test.ts` | 7 suites | PASSED |
| `tests/mcp-addictiveness.test.ts` (Phase 20) | 50 | PASSED |

| `tests/browser-verification.test.ts` | 6 suites | PASSED |
| `tests/unification.test.ts` | 5 suites | PASSED |

### Remaining from Audit (Not in Scope)

These items from the audit require external decisions or infra and were not addressed in this pass:

- **CI/CD scaffolding** (.github/workflows, Dockerfile, deploy config) — needs hosting decision
- **Placeholder admin pages** (billing, members, organization, system-health) — need design decisions
- **Job queue + audit scheduler persistence** — needs Redis/BullMQ decision
- **Playwright runtime stability** — flaky real-browser test needs investigation
- **README.md** — still SaaSBold boilerplate

### Current State After Stabilization

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| ESLint | BLOCKED (config conflict) | Fixed (valid JSON, no duplicates) |
| TypeScript | es5 target, broken include | es2022, clean include |
| Node engine | `>=14.0.0` (EOL) | `>=18.18.0` |
| Build | Coupled to Google Fonts fetch | Deterministic (next/font/google only) |
| Scripts | No `typecheck` / `test` | Both present |
| Prisma schema | Missing 5 Phase 20 models | All models present |
| Seed script | Stub/template | Executable |
| Production startup | Not wired | `instrumentation.ts` runs on boot |
| Demo org fallbacks | Hardcoded in 3 places | Session-based resolution |
| Error tracking | Library only | Wired into critical routes |
| MCP context | Lost after analysis | Bootstrapped + persisted |
| Store enforcement | Missing MCP persistence | Full coverage |

## Phase 21 — 2026-03-28 — Production Readiness Audit Snapshot

### Goal
Do a full production-readiness pass across features and infrastructure, capture the current state with evidence, and define the shortest path to a dev-environment deploy.

### Scope Audited
- Frontend app shells and critical product surfaces
- Backend APIs and MCP execution flow
- Prisma/database readiness
- Jobs, SSE, and long-running state
- Auth, env validation, observability, and production guards
- Build/lint/typecheck/test pipeline

### Executed Checks

| Check | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `npm run check-lint` | **FAILED** | ESLint cannot resolve `react-hooks` uniquely because `.eslintrc.json` extends `plugin:react-hooks/recommended` while `eslint-config-next` brings another copy. |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | **FAILED** | Large compile surface broken. Biggest buckets: `tsconfig.json` still targets `es5`, Prisma/domain typing drift, missing/nullability cleanup, and some stale test expectations. |
| `npm run build` | **FAILED** | `prisma generate` passes, but Next build stops on Google Fonts fetch: `src/app/layout.tsx` uses `next/font/google` and `src/styles/globals.css` also imports Google Fonts. |
| Core engine tests | **PASSED** | `tests/all.test.ts` → 14/14 suites passed. |
| MCP tests | **PASSED** | `tests/mcp.test.ts` → 7/7 suites passed. |
| Production lock tests | **PASSED** | `tests/production-lock.test.ts` → 8/8 suites passed. |
| Production hardening tests | **PASSED** | `tests/production-hardening.test.ts` → 61/61 passed. |
| Production wiring tests | **PASSED** | `tests/production-wiring.test.ts` → 9/9 suites passed. |
| MCP addictiveness tests | **PASSED** | `tests/mcp-addictiveness.test.ts` → 50/50 passed. |
| SaaS auth runtime tests | **PASSED** | `tests/saas-auth-runtime.test.ts` → 13/13 suites passed. |
| Browser verification tests | **PASSED** | `tests/browser-verification.test.ts` → 6/6 suites passed. |
| Route unification tests | **PASSED** | `tests/unification.test.ts` → 5/5 suites passed. |
| Playwright runtime tests | **PARTIAL / FLAKY** | `tests/playwright-runtime.test.ts` later failed on the real-browser path (`expected false, got true`), so the runtime/browser dependency path is not stable yet. |

### Current Readiness Summary

| Area | Status | Current State |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Domain engine / projections / MCP core logic | **Strong** | Core computation layer is well-covered and passing. |
| SaaS auth runtime | **Strong** | Store, secret handling, runtime behavior, and answer logic are passing in tests. |
| Frontend product shell | **Partial** | Main product pages exist, but some surfaces still rely on demo/default context or placeholder data. |
| Database + Prisma | **Blocked** | Schema exists, but migrations are missing and new Phase 20 persistence models are not in Prisma schema. |
| Production startup / guardrails | **Partial** | Guard code exists and tests pass, but startup enforcement is not wired into real app bootstrap. |
| Jobs / SSE / scheduled work | **Blocked for production** | Queue/cache/scheduler state is still mostly in-memory. |
| Observability / admin ops | **Partial** | APIs and dashboards exist, but several metrics stores are in-memory and some UI pages are placeholder-only. |
| Dev deploy readiness | **Blocked** | Build/lint/typecheck are red, runtime contract is not fully wired, and deployment scaffolding is absent. |

### Key Findings

**1. Release pipeline is not green yet**
- `package.json` has no canonical `test` or `typecheck` script, so validation must currently be run manually.
- `package.json` still declares `"node": ">=14.0.0"`, while installed `next@15.5.14` requires `^18.18.0 || ^19.8.0 || >=20.0.0`.
- `.eslintrc.json` conflicts with `eslint-config-next` on `react-hooks`, so linting is blocked before real lint findings can even be evaluated.
- `tsconfig.json` targets `es5`, but the codebase now uses `Map`, `Set`, iterator spread, and regex features that require a newer target or `downlevelIteration`.

**2. Build is coupled to external font fetches**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` imports `Inter` from `next/font/google`.
- `src/styles/globals.css` also imports Google Fonts directly.
- In this environment, `npm run build` stops at the font fetch step, which means the build is not deterministic/offline-safe yet.

**3. Phase 20 persistence is designed but not finished end-to-end**
- `apps/platform/mcp-persistence.ts` expects Prisma models for:
  - `mcpPromptEvent`
  - `mcpSession`
  - `mcpSuggestionClick`
  - `playbookRun`
  - `analysisJob`
- Those models are not present in `prisma/schema.prisma`, so the persistence layer is not schema-complete.
- `prisma/` has no migrations directory, and `prisma/seed.ts` is still a template/documentation stub, not a real seed flow.

**4. Production hardening exists mostly as library code, not app bootstrap**
- `apps/platform/startup.ts`, `apps/platform/store-enforcement.ts`, and `apps/platform/production-state-lock.ts` are implemented and tested.
- Search across `src/`, `apps/`, `workers/`, and `prisma/` shows they are not invoked from the running app paths.
- This means production lock / store enforcement is present conceptually, but not yet guaranteed in the actual server lifecycle.

**5. MCP runtime wiring is incomplete in the actual app**
- `src/lib/mcp-client.ts` and `src/lib/console-data.ts` assume an in-process `McpServer`.
- `apps/mcp/bootstrap.ts` exists, but app code does not currently call `bootstrapMcpContext()` or `bootstrapMcpContextSync()`.
- `src/app/api/analysis/stream/route.ts` recomputes findings and streams them, but does not bootstrap/persist MCP context for later console pages.
- Result: analysis can stream findings live, but the broader MCP console flow still depends on runtime state that is not reliably established across pages/requests.

**6. Several app surfaces still use demo/default placeholders**
- `src/app/(console)/layout.tsx` and `src/app/app/layout.tsx` both inject default org context (`demo`, `Demo Org`, `env_1`, `shop.com`).
- `src/app/api/usage/route.ts` falls back to `orgId = "demo"` and `plan = "vestigio"` if session fields are absent.
- `src/app/app/settings/data-sources/page.tsx` still has `default_env` TODO-based environment resolution.
- `src/app/app/billing/page.tsx`, `src/app/app/members/page.tsx`, `src/app/app/organization/page.tsx`, and `src/app/(site)/admin/system-health/page.tsx` are still placeholder UX surfaces with production comments instead of real data wiring.

**7. Operational state is still in-memory in critical places**
- `apps/platform/job-queue.ts` is still in-memory.
- `apps/platform/audit-scheduler.ts` is still in-memory and not wired to an external scheduler/cron.
- `src/app/api/analysis/stream/route.ts` keeps SSE reconnect cache in memory.
- `apps/platform/mcp-observability.ts` stores sessions in memory.
- `apps/mcp/playbooks.ts`, `apps/mcp/prompt-gate.ts`, and `apps/mcp/suggestion-engine-v2.ts` track operational metrics in memory rather than through the new persistence layer.
- This matches the intention behind Phase 20, but it means the production-state story is not closed yet.

**8. Error tracking and observability wiring are incomplete**
- `src/libs/error-tracker.ts` can persist `PlatformError`, but `withErrorTracking()` is not used by API routes.
- Admin usage/health views exist, but they are not yet backed by a fully persistent operational telemetry pipeline.
- Observability coverage is better at the module/test level than at the app/runtime level.

**9. Repo/deploy packaging is still light**
- No `.github/workflows` directory is present.
- No `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose`, `vercel.json`, `Procfile`, `railway.json`, or `fly.toml` was found.
- `README.md` is still SaaSBold boilerplate, so the repo’s deployment/runtime instructions are not yet Vestigio-specific.

### What Looks Solid Already
- Core domain/evidence/graph/recompute/projection engine
- MCP server resource and answer logic
- Production hardening concepts and tests
- SaaS access store, secret handling, authenticated runtime, and public-view safety
- Browser verification module-level flows
- Route unification logic between legacy and `/app` surfaces

### Practical Next Steps

**Priority 0 — make the release gates truthful**
1. Fix ESLint config conflict so `npm run check-lint` actually evaluates code.
2. Add explicit scripts for `typecheck` and `test`.
3. Update Node engine in `package.json` to the actual supported runtime.

**Priority 1 — restore deterministic buildability**
1. Remove duplicate Google Fonts dependency paths.
2. Move to local/self-hosted fonts or otherwise make build independent from network font fetches.
3. Raise TS target (`es2020` or newer) and fix resulting compile issues until `npx tsc --noEmit` is green.

**Priority 2 — close the DB/runtime contract**
1. Add Prisma migrations for the current multi-tenant/control-plane schema.
2. Add missing Phase 20 persistence models to `prisma/schema.prisma`.
3. Turn `prisma/seed.ts` into a real executable seed for admin/config bootstrap.

**Priority 3 — wire production enforcement into the app**
1. Call startup/store initialization from a real server bootstrap path.
2. Initialize Prisma-backed stores in production.
3. Enforce `enforceProductionLock()` in the runtime, not only in tests.

**Priority 4 — remove hidden demo/runtime assumptions**
1. Replace demo/default org/env context in layouts and `/api/usage`.
2. Resolve org, plan, and environment from real session + membership data.
3. Finish data wiring for Billing, Members, Organization, System Health, and Data Sources pages.

**Priority 5 — make MCP state survive real operation**
1. Persist jobs, sessions, playbook runs, prompt events, and suggestion clicks through the Phase 20 store layer.
2. Decide which SSE/session caches may remain ephemeral and document that explicitly.
3. Wire `bootstrapMcpContext` or an equivalent persistence/bootstrap path after analysis runs so the rest of the console can rely on real context.

### Recommended Next Deploy Sequence
1. Green the release gates: lint, typecheck, build.
2. Add migrations + seed and boot a local/dev Postgres-backed environment.
3. Wire startup/store enforcement and remove demo org/env fallbacks.
4. Validate onboarding → analysis stream → MCP console → data sources → admin usage end-to-end in a dev deploy.
5. Only after that, start polishing observability depth and secondary admin surfaces.

### Bottom Line
The project is **logic-strong but runtime-incomplete**.

The engine, MCP reasoning, SaaS auth runtime, and a lot of the hardening work are in very good shape at the module/test level. The blockers are mostly in the last mile: build determinism, TypeScript baseline, Prisma/runtime synchronization, production-store wiring, and removal of demo/in-memory assumptions from the actual app shell.

This is close enough to be a good dev-deploy candidate **after one focused stabilization pass**, but it is **not production-ready today**.

## Phase 20 — 2026-03-28 — MCP Addictiveness Layer + Production State Lock

### Goal
Make MCP feel proactive, sticky, high-value, and guided. Ensure all production paths use persistent state — no hidden in-memory runtime assumptions.

### New Files Created (10)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `apps/mcp/prompt-gate.ts` | Query draft layer — detects misfires, vague/broad prompts, suggests rewrites. Never blocks users. Tracks prompt quality metrics. |
| `apps/mcp/suggestion-engine-v2.ts` | Enhanced suggestions with best-next-question/analysis/action/navigation, chain suggestions, usage notes, click tracking. |
| `apps/mcp/playbooks.ts` | 6 built-in playbook flows (revenue leaks, conversion, chargeback, onboarding, trust, landing vs app). Plan-gated, budget-aware execution tracking. |
| `apps/mcp/context-chaining.ts` | Deterministic chaining: finding→root_cause→action→verification, revenue→trust, SaaS→landing_mismatch. All based on projections, never hallucinated. |
| `apps/platform/production-state-lock.ts` | Full-pass validation of all subsystems (7 checks). Enforces persistent stores in production. Fail-fast on missing Prisma. Health check endpoint. |
| `apps/platform/mcp-observability.ts` | MCP-specific admin metrics: session tracking, prompt gate rates, playbook usage, suggestion clicks, avg chain depth. |
| `apps/platform/plan-config-admin.ts` | Tunable plan parameters: MCP budget, Playwright budget, audit frequency, cost assumptions, margin estimates. Change log. |
| `apps/platform/mcp-persistence.ts` | Persistent models: McpPromptEvent, McpSessionRecord, McpSuggestionClick, PlaybookRunRecord, AnalysisJobRecord. InMemory + Prisma stores. |

### Modified Files (5)

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/app/(console)/chat/page.tsx` | Full rewrite: integrated prompt gate, playbooks drawer, budget bar, chain suggestions, usage-aware UX, playbook execution flow. |
| `src/components/console/McpUsageIndicator.tsx` | Added `McpUsageContext` + `useMcpUsage()` hook + `useUsageData()` for shared usage state across components. |
| `src/app/api/admin/usage/route.ts` | Added 3 new views: `mcp_observability`, `plan_config`, `health` (production lock status). |
| `apps/mcp/index.ts` | Exported all Phase 20 modules: prompt-gate, suggestion-engine-v2, playbooks, context-chaining. |
| `apps/platform/index.ts` | Exported all Phase 20 modules: production-state-lock, mcp-observability, plan-config-admin, mcp-persistence. |

### Key Decisions

**Prompt Gate Logic**
- `evaluatePromptDraft(input, context)` returns `{ quality, reason, suggested_rewrite, should_confirm }`
- Misfire detection: empty, single char, greetings, just dots/question marks
- Vague detection: "help", "what", meta-questions
- Broad detection: "what's wrong", "check my site", "how am I doing"
- Repetition detection: against last 5 questions
- Budget-aware: near limit suggests higher-value rewrites
- NEVER blocks — always shows "Send original anyway"

**Playbooks**
- 6 built-in: find_revenue_leaks, improve_conversion, reduce_chargeback_risk, audit_onboarding, check_trust, landing_vs_app
- Plan-gated: chargeback + landing require Pro
- Budget-checked: must have enough daily queries for all steps
- Steps map to existing MCP tools — deterministic, not generative

**Context Chaining**
- finding → root_cause (caused_by)
- root_cause → action (fixed_by)
- action → verification (verified_by)
- revenue_issue → trust_onboarding (trust_impact)
- saas_issue → landing_mismatch (mismatch_detected)
- All chains derived from actual projections/findings/actions
- Chain paths up to depth 3, sorted by estimated value

**Production State Lock**
- 7 subsystem checks: daily_usage, mcp_usage, saas_access, auth_logs, job_queue, sse_event_cache, mcp_session
- In dev: in-memory acceptable, all pass
- In production: requires persistent stores for 5 of 7 (SSE cache + auth logs have acceptable patterns)
- `enforceProductionLock()` throws `ProductionLockError` with failure list
- `getProductionHealthCheck()` exposes via admin API

**MCP Persistence Models**
- McpPromptEvent: prompt gate evaluation records
- McpSessionRecord: session summaries with plan, queries, depth
- McpSuggestionClick: which suggestions users interact with
- PlaybookRunRecord: playbook execution state
- AnalysisJobRecord: persistent job state for restart survival
- Both InMemory and Prisma implementations provided

### Tests

`tests/mcp-addictiveness.test.ts` — **50 tests, all passing**

| Group | Count | Coverage |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Prompt Gate | 13 | Misfire (5), weak (4), good (2), budget-aware (1), metrics (1) |
| Playbooks | 9 | Existence (1), plan gating (3), budget (2), run tracking (2), stats (1) |
| Suggestion Engine v2 | 2 | Click recording, stats aggregation |
| Context Chaining | 1 | Function exports verification |
| Production State Lock | 4 | Dev mode validation, subsystem coverage, SSE/auth patterns |
| Admin Observability | 2 | Session tracking, dashboard aggregation |
| Plan Config Admin | 7 | Defaults, all configs, update, clamping, economics (2), change log |
| MCP Persistence | 6 | Prompt events, sessions, clicks, playbook runs, jobs, job upsert |
| Cross-Module Integration | 5 | Budget + playbook, budget + prompt gate, dashboard shape, economics |

### How to Test

**Weak prompt path:**
```
evaluatePromptDraft('help', context) → { quality: 'weak', suggested_rewrite: '...' }
evaluatePromptDraft('', context) → { quality: 'misfire' }
evaluatePromptDraft('What are the top 3 revenue leaks?', context) → { quality: 'good' }
```

**Playbook path:**
```
canRunPlaybook('find_revenue_leaks', 'vestigio', 10) → { allowed: true }
canRunPlaybook('reduce_chargeback_risk', 'vestigio', 10) → { allowed: false, reason: 'requires pro' }
startPlaybookRun('check_trust', 'org1') → run tracking begins
```

**Production mode validation:**
```
validateProductionLock() → { all_passed: true } (in dev)
enforceProductionLock() → throws in production without Prisma stores
```

## Phase 19 — 2026-03-28 — Production Hardening + Smart Usage System

### What was implemented
Daily capacity-based usage model (replacing monthly credits), MCP guard with per-org daily limits, cost guardrails preventing runaway operations, continuous audit scheduler with plan-based frequency, crawl constraint system (max pages, depth limits, dedup, loop detection, SPA detection), analysis job queue with 1-per-environment concurrency, SSE resilience (reconnect via Last-Event-ID, heartbeat, idempotent event IDs), data consistency (finding dedup, deterministic sorting/scoring), billing safety (overflow protection, auditable usage logs, safe math), admin usage dashboard with unit economics panel, MCP usage radial indicator in console header, and SaaS feature clarity (setup-required banners, gated feature labels, explicit failure states).

### 1. MCP Usage Control — Daily Capacity Model

#### Plan Limits (`packages/plans/types.ts`, `packages/plans/entitlements.ts`)

| Plan | Daily MCP Budget | Playwright Budget | Audit Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vestigio | 5 | 0 | none |
| Pro | 25 | 5 | low (24h) |
| Max | 100 | 20 | high (12h) |

New `PlanLimits` type with `daily_mcp_budget`, `audit_frequency`, `playwright_budget`. Every `PlanEntitlements` now includes a `limits` field.

#### MCP Guard (`apps/platform/daily-usage.ts`)

`canExecuteMcpQuery(orgId, plan)` — checks daily usage against plan budget. Returns `allowed` or `blocked` with reason. Also: `canExecutePlaywright()` for headless browser guard.

#### Daily Usage Tracking (`apps/platform/daily-usage.ts`)

Per-org daily tracking of `mcp_queries`, `estimated_tokens`, `playwright_runs`. In-memory store with `PrismaDailyUsageStore` for production. `DailyUsageSummary` includes remaining counts and percentage used.

### 2. Cost Guardrails (`apps/platform/cost-guardrails.ts`)

`shouldExecuteExpensiveOperation(context, plan)` — prevents:
- Excessive Playwright runs (hard cap: 30/day)
- Deep crawl loops (hard cap: 10/day)
- Redundant full audits (hard cap: 3/day)
- MCP budget overruns (hard cap: 150/day)

Also includes crawl-level URL dedup via `recordCrawlUrl()` with loop detection.

### 3. Continuous Audit Scheduler (`apps/platform/audit-scheduler.ts`)

| Plan | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Vestigio | No continuous audit |
| Pro | Daily incremental (max 2/day) |
| Max | Event-driven + periodic every 12h (max 6/day) |

Triggers: `onboarding_complete`, `manual_refresh`, `time_based`, `mcp_triggered`.
Audit types: `incremental` (reuse graph, validate critical paths) and `full` (rare, full re-analysis).
`isAuditDue()` checks interval since last audit. Lifecycle: pending → running → complete/failed.

### 4. Collection Hardening (`workers/ingestion/crawl-constraints.ts`)

**CrawlSession** enforces per-crawl:
- Max 30 pages per domain
- Max depth 3
- Per-request timeout 10s
- Global timeout 60s
- Max body size 2MB
- URL deduplication (strips tracking params)
- Content-hash loop detection
- Safe abort with reason

**SPA Detection**: `detectSpaPage()` identifies JS-heavy pages (React, Next.js, Nuxt, Angular, Gatsby). `shouldTriggerPlaywright()` decides if headless needed based on thin content + high script count.

**Pipeline Integration**: Staged pipeline now uses `CrawlSession` for all crawl-stage fetches. SPA detection emits step event when detected. Loop-detected pages skipped with low confidence.

### 5. Execution Orchestration (`apps/platform/job-queue.ts`)

`AnalysisJob` with status: `queued | running | partial | complete | failed`.

- 1 active job per environment
- Global concurrency limit (5)
- Progress tracking with stage recording
- Retry creates new job preserving completed stages
- Queue promotion when slots free up

### 6. SSE Resilience (`src/app/api/analysis/stream/route.ts`)

- **Reconnect**: `Last-Event-ID` header support. Event cache per user+domain (5min TTL). On reconnect, replays missed events.
- **Idempotent Events**: Every event has unique `id` field (`{jobId}_{counter}`).
- **Heartbeat**: 15s keep-alive comments prevent connection drops.
- **Job Integration**: Stream creates/starts/completes job. Blocked if job already running for environment.
- **Progress Tracking**: Stage completions update job progress (20% → 40% → 70% → 100%).

### 7. Data Consistency (`apps/platform/data-consistency.ts`)

- `deduplicateFindings()`: Same `inference_key` → keep highest confidence, then highest impact.
- `deterministicSort()`: Polarity → impact → confidence → alphabetical key. Fully stable.
- `computeStableScore()`: Deterministic hash from sorted findings. Same input always produces same hash.

### 8. Billing Safety (`apps/platform/billing-safety.ts`)

- `safeIncrementMcpUsage()` / `safeIncrementPlaywrightUsage()`: Check limit before incrementing. Log every operation.
- `safeSubtract()` / `safeAdd()`: Never negative, never overflow max.
- Auditable usage log with 10K entry cap. Filterable by org.

#### Unit Economics

- `estimateDailyCost()`: $0.02/MCP query, $0.15/Playwright run, $0.03/1K tokens.
- `computePlanUnitEconomics()`: Monthly price vs max monthly cost → margin percentage.
- All plans have positive margin.

### 9. Admin Observability

#### Usage Dashboard (`src/app/(site)/admin/usage-billing/page.tsx`)

Two tabs:
- **Usage**: Per-org daily breakdown (MCP queries, Playwright runs, tokens, estimated cost, over-limit status). Summary cards with totals. Date picker.
- **Unit Economics**: Per-plan table showing monthly price, max daily/monthly cost, margin percentage. Color-coded margin (green >50%, amber 20-50%, red <20%).

#### Admin API (`src/app/api/admin/usage/route.ts`)

`GET /api/admin/usage` — views: `summary` (org usage), `unit_economics` (plan margins), `log` (audit trail). ADMIN role required.

#### Overview Page (`src/app/app/admin/overview/page.tsx`)

Now wired to live data. Shows organization count, MCP queries today, Playwright runs, estimated cost. Amber warning when orgs exceed daily limits.

### 10. MCP Usage Indicator (`src/components/console/McpUsageIndicator.tsx`)

Radial progress ring in console header:
- Shows % of daily MCP budget used
- Green (<60%), amber (60-85%), red (>85%)
- Tooltip: "MCP: X/Y today (Z left)"
- Auto-refreshes every 30s
- API: `GET /api/usage` returns `DailyUsageSummary`

### 11. SaaS Clarity (`src/app/app/settings/data-sources/page.tsx`)

- **Setup Required Banner**: Amber warning when SaaS access not configured. Explains what's blocked.
- **Verification Failed Banner**: Red error with failure reason. States SaaS Growth paused.
- **MFA Awaiting Banner**: Amber warning with manual action guidance.
- **Feature Gate Labels**: Each data source shows "Unlocks: ..." when not yet configured.
- **No Silent Failures**: Every state has explicit, visible UI feedback.

### 12. Tests (`tests/production-hardening.test.ts`)

61 tests covering all Phase 19 systems:
- MCP daily limits: allows/blocks correctly per plan, independent org limits, percentage tracking
- Cost guardrails: hard caps enforced, crawl URL dedup, count tracking
- Audit scheduler: plan gating, triggers, lifecycle, daily limits, due detection
- Collection: max pages, dedup, loop detection, content hash, abort, timeout, SPA detection
- Job queue: create, 1-per-env, concurrent envs, progress, complete/free, retry preserves stages
- Data consistency: dedup, deterministic sort, stable hash, correct polarity counts
- Billing safety: blocks at limit, safe math (no negatives/overflow), cost estimation, auditable log
- Plan entitlements: all plans have limits, frequency/budget scaling correct

## Phase 18.5 — 2026-03-28 — Collection Evolution + Live Analysis UX

### What was implemented
Multi-stage ingestion pipeline for fast time-to-value, SSE streaming endpoint for live analysis, finding polarity (negative/positive/neutral), progressive UI with step timeline and skeleton loading, challenge detection for WAF/protection layers, coverage model tracking route validation, and 50 human-language analysis step messages.

### Multi-Stage Pipeline (`workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts`)

4 stages for progressive analysis:

| Stage | Timing | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| A: Bootstrap Discovery | 0-3s | Root fetch, parse, initial links/forms/scripts |
| B: First Value Synthesis | <10s | Initial classification, first indicators |
| C: Prioritized Crawl | 10-30s | High-value surfaces (checkout, pricing, login, policies) |
| D: Selective Headless | On-demand | SPA resolution, CTA ambiguity (reserved) |

Emits `PipelineEvent` callbacks for SSE streaming throughout execution.

### Coverage Model
Every discovered route tracked with: `discovered`, `validated`, `critical`, `confidence`.
Global `CoverageSummary`: score (0-100), total/validated/critical routes, gaps, challenged flag.

### Challenge Detection
Detects: Cloudflare, reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, DataDome, Akamai, rate limiting.
On detection: emits `challenge_detected` event, marks route as unvalidated, surfaces warning in UI with remediation steps.

### Finding Polarity (`packages/projections/`)

Every `FindingProjection` now has `polarity: 'negative' | 'positive' | 'neutral'`.

**Negative** — issues with quantified $ impact (all existing findings)
**Positive** — healthy signals where no issues detected:
- Strong CTA clarity
- Good trust continuity across checkout
- Complete policy coverage
- Low friction checkout path
- Analytics measurement well covered
- Support channels accessible

**Neutral** — structural observations (future use)

Sort order: negatives first (by impact), then neutrals, then positives.

### SSE Streaming Endpoint (`src/app/api/analysis/stream/route.ts`)

`GET /api/analysis/stream?domain=...&environment_id=...`

Streams events via Server-Sent Events:
- `step` — human-language progress message
- `finding_ready` — incremental finding availability
- `score_update` — classification + evidence count
- `coverage_update` — route coverage progress
- `stage_complete` — pipeline stage finished
- `challenge_detected` — WAF/protection block
- `findings` — final projected findings array
- `score` — final score with polarity breakdown
- `complete` — analysis finished

### 50 Human-Language Step Messages

Examples: "Getting familiar with your business", "Understanding how users enter your funnel", "Checking trust and credibility signals", "Spotting missed opportunities", "Putting everything together". No technical jargon.

### Live Analysis UI (`src/app/(console)/analysis/page.tsx`)

- **Step timeline** — animated progress with current step + history
- **Coverage bar** — real-time coverage percentage
- **Skeleton loading** — placeholder rows while findings arrive
- **Progressive table** — findings replace skeletons as they arrive
- **Challenge warning** — amber banner with protection type + remediation
- **Polarity filtering** — dropdown: All / Issues / Positive / Neutral
- **Hide positive** — checkbox to filter out healthy signals
- **SaaS Growth pack** — added to pack filter dropdown
- **Summary cards** — show issues + strengths count, updated during analysis
- **Analysis state** — `idle | ongoing | complete` with appropriate UI per state

### Files Created (3)
- `workers/ingestion/staged-pipeline.ts` — multi-stage pipeline with coverage + challenge detection
- `src/app/api/analysis/stream/route.ts` — SSE endpoint
- `tests/collection-evolution.test.ts` — 11 tests, 6 suites

### Files Modified (3)

- `packages/projections/engine.ts` — polarity assignment + positive findings generation
- `src/app/(console)/analysis/page.tsx` — full rewrite: live analysis, step timeline, polarity, filtering

### Tests — 11 new tests, 6 suites, zero regression
- Pipeline — Step Messages (3)
- Finding Polarity — Assigned Correctly (4)
- Polarity Filtering (1)
- Coverage Model (1)
- Pipeline — Classification in Output (1)
- SSE — Event Structure (1)

## Phase 18 — 2026-03-28 — SaaS Intelligence Pack

### What was implemented
Full SaaS intelligence pipeline: authenticated evidence types, SaaS signal extraction, SaaS inference engine, impact baselines, a 4th decision pack (`saas_growth_readiness`), projection integration (SaaS findings appear in unified Analysis), and MCP SaaS-specific answers. Cross-surface intelligence (landing page vs app experience mismatch). Eligibility enforcement ensures zero false positives.

### SaaS Evidence Types (6 new)
| Type | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AuthenticatedPageView` | Playwright | Pages viewed inside the SaaS app |
| `ActivationStepObserved` | Playwright | Onboarding/activation steps with complexity + CTA presence |
| `EmptyStateObserved` | Playwright | Empty states with/without guidance |
| `UpgradeSurfaceObserved` | Playwright | Upgrade CTAs with visibility + value proposition |
| `FeatureUsageSurface` | Playwright | Feature pages observed |
| `NavigationStructureObserved` | Playwright | Nav structure: items, depth, search, help |

### SaaS Signal Layer (`packages/signals/saas-signals.ts`)
14 signal types extracted from authenticated evidence:

**Activation:** `activation_flow_detected`, `onboarding_steps_count`, `activation_complexity_high`, `activation_unclear_next_step`, `activation_no_progress`, `time_to_value_estimate`
**Product UX:** `empty_state_detected`, `empty_state_no_guidance`, `navigation_complexity`, `navigation_deep`, `navigation_no_search`
**Upgrade:** `upgrade_surface_present`, `upgrade_surface_visibility`, `upgrade_no_value_prop`
**Cross-surface:** `landing_app_complexity_gap`

### SaaS Inference Engine (`packages/inference/saas-inference.ts`)
10 inferences grouped into 4 categories:

**Activation:** `activation_blocked`, `activation_friction_high`, `unclear_next_step`
**UX/Product:** `empty_state_without_guidance`, `navigation_overcomplex`, `feature_discovery_poor`
**Monetization:** `upgrade_invisible`, `upgrade_timing_wrong`, `no_expansion_path`
**Cross-Surface:** `landing_app_mismatch` (landing page claims vs actual app experience)

### SaaS Impact Baselines (`packages/impact/baselines.ts`)
10 new baselines mapping SaaS inferences to financial impact:

| Inference | Impact Type | High Range |
|---|---|---|
| activation_blocked | conversion_loss | 15-35% of revenue |
| upgrade_invisible | revenue_loss | 10-30% of revenue |
| landing_app_mismatch | conversion_loss | 12-30% of revenue |
| no_expansion_path | revenue_loss | 12-35% of revenue |
| activation_friction_high | conversion_loss | 10-25% of revenue |

### SaaS Decision Pack (`saas_growth_readiness`)
4th decision pack in `recomputeAll()`:
- Only computed when `saas_pack` eligibility passes
- SaaS signals extracted and merged into main pipeline
- SaaS inferences computed from merged signal set
- Decision + risk evaluation + actions produced
- Integrated into intelligence layer (root causes, global actions)
- Impact estimated alongside existing packs
- **Returns `null` when not eligible — no false positives**

### Projection Integration
- SaaS findings appear in the **unified Analysis table** (not a separate UI)
- `INFERENCE_TO_PACK` extended with 10 SaaS inference → pack mappings
- `INFERENCE_SURFACES` extended with SaaS app surfaces (`/app (onboarding)`, `/app (billing)`, etc.)
- `INFERENCE_TITLES` extended with human-readable titles
- SaaS `WorkspaceProjection` added when eligible and has findings
- Each finding carries `eligibility: { eligible, confidence }`

### MCP Integration (`apps/mcp/answers.ts`)
`composeSaasGrowthAnswer(ctx)` — structured answer with:
- Count of SaaS issues by category (activation, UX, monetization, mismatch)
- Total estimated impact in $/mo
- Top 3 issues with impact values
- SaaS-specific suggested questions:
  - "Why are users not upgrading?"
  - "Where is onboarding failing?"
  - "What should I fix first to improve activation?"
  - "Does my landing page align with the app experience?"
- Falls back to suggesting authenticated verification when no SaaS evidence exists

### Cross-Surface Intelligence
The `landing_app_mismatch` inference correlates:
- **Landing page claims** (structural evidence from crawl)
- **Actual app experience** (authenticated evidence from Playwright)

Triggers when: landing page implies simplicity but app requires 3+ complex activation steps without onboarding prompts.

Example finding: *"Landing page promises X, but app requires complex onboarding"*

### Files Created (3)
- `packages/signals/saas-signals.ts` — 14 SaaS signal types
- `packages/inference/saas-inference.ts` — 10 SaaS inferences
- `tests/saas-intelligence.test.ts` — 21 tests, 11 suites

### Files Modified (8)
- `packages/domain/enums.ts` — 6 evidence types, 4 signal categories, 10 inference categories
- `packages/domain/evidence.ts` — 5 SaaS payload interfaces
- `packages/signals/index.ts` — export `extractSaasSignals`
- `packages/inference/index.ts` — export `computeSaasInferences`
- `packages/impact/baselines.ts` — 10 SaaS impact baselines

- `packages/projections/engine.ts` — SaaS mappings + workspace + eligibility
- `apps/mcp/answers.ts` + `index.ts` — `composeSaasGrowthAnswer`

### Tests — 21 new tests, 11 suites, zero regression
- SaaS Signals — Activation (3)
- SaaS Signals — Empty States (1)

## Phase 17.8 — 2026-03-28 — Classification & Eligibility Guardrails

### What was implemented
Central classification engine with probabilistic business model hypotheses, eligibility engine that gates every pack/finding/verification/MCP suggestion, credit enforcement wired into executor, persistent auth logging via Prisma, and environment context resolver preventing cross-org leakage.

### Classification Engine (`packages/classification/`)

`computeClassification(input) → ClassificationState`

**Business model hypotheses** (0→1): `saas`, `ecommerce`, `leadgen`, `services`, `content`
**Conversion surface hypotheses** (0→1): `checkout`, `form`, `whatsapp`, `chat`, `booking`, `login`

Rules: baseline confidence → onboarding prior (0.4) → evidence adjustment (0.25 per signal) → normalize. Ambiguity when top-2 within 0.15. Login form increases `login` surface (NOT defines SaaS). Checkout increases `ecommerce` (NOT defines it).

### Eligibility Engine (`packages/classification/eligibility.ts`)

Global rule: nothing executes without passing eligibility.

| Check | Threshold |
|---|---|
| SaaS Pack | saas ≥ 0.6 OR onboarding is_saas |
| Auth Verification | login ≥ 0.3 + SaaS profile + access + no MFA |
| Checkout/Revenue | checkout ≥ 0.3 OR ecommerce ≥ 0.3 |
| Chargeback | checkout ≥ 0.3 OR ecommerce ≥ 0.3 |
| Scale Readiness | Always eligible |

Every `FindingProjection` now carries `eligibility: { eligible, confidence }`.

### Pipeline Integration
`recomputeAll()` computes classification + pack eligibility alongside existing pipeline. `MultiPackResult` extended with `classification` and `pack_eligibility`.

### Credit Enforcement
`AuthenticatedJourneyExecutor` checks `canAffordVerification()` BEFORE execution, returns `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` if blocked. Consumes 10 credits after execution. `setOrgContext(orgId, plan)` configures billing.

### Environment Context (`apps/platform/environment-context.ts`)
`resolveEnvironmentContext()` validates user membership. `validateEnvironmentOwnership()` prevents cross-org leakage.

### Auth Logs Persistence
Dual-layer: in-memory + Prisma `AuthEvent` table. `setAuthLogPrisma()` enables DB persistence. Wired into `initializeStores()`.

### Files Created (6)
- `packages/classification/types.ts`, `engine.ts`, `eligibility.ts`, `index.ts`
- `apps/platform/environment-context.ts`
- `tests/classification-eligibility.test.ts` — 27 tests, 10 suites

### Files Modified (8)
- `packages/workspace/recompute.ts` — classification in pipeline
- `packages/projections/types.ts` + `engine.ts` — eligibility on findings
- `workers/verification/executors.ts` — credit enforcement
- `apps/platform/auth-logging.ts` — Prisma persistence
- `apps/platform/store-enforcement.ts` — auth log wiring
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — `AuthEvent` model
- `apps/platform/index.ts` — exports

### Tests — 20 files total, 27 new tests, zero regression

## Phase 18 — 2026-03-28 — Production Readiness Audit & Security Hardening

### What was implemented
Full production-readiness audit covering security hardening, observability system, SEO basics, and code quality. All critical and high-severity vulnerabilities fixed. Built-in error tracking system with admin dashboard. SEO fundamentals (robots.txt, sitemap, metadata) added. Security headers, rate limiting, and email TLS enabled.

### Critical Security Fixes (7)

**1. Password reset endpoint accepted password changes without token verification**
- `src/app/api/forgot-password/update/route.ts` — now requires `token` field, validates against DB with expiry check
- `src/app/api/forgot-password/update/schema.ts` — added `token` to Zod schema
- `src/components/Auth/ResetPassword/index.tsx` — frontend now sends token with update request

**2. API key generation was unauthenticated and used role string instead of random bytes**
- `src/app/api/api-key/generate/route.ts` — added session auth, generates `vst_` prefixed crypto random keys
- `src/app/api/api-key/generate/schema.ts` — removed `email` field (derived from session)
- `src/actions/api-key.ts` — server action also fixed with random key generation + ownership check on delete

**3. Content generation endpoint was publicly accessible with user-supplied API key**
- `src/app/api/generate-content/route.ts` — added auth check, removed user-supplied apiKey parameter, validates prompt format

**4. Paddle/LemonSqueezy subscription endpoints had no authentication**
- `src/app/api/paddle/cancel-subscription/route.ts` — added session auth + subscription ownership verification
- `src/app/api/paddle/change-plan/route.ts` — added session auth + subscription ownership verification
- `src/app/api/lemon-squeezy/cancel-subscription/route.ts` — added session auth + subscription ownership verification

**5. API key validation was fundamentally broken (compared role string to bcrypt hash)**
- `src/libs/isValidAPIKey.ts` — complete rewrite: now iterates stored hashed keys and compares with bcrypt
- `src/app/api/example/admin/protected/route.ts` — updated to use new API
- `src/app/api/example/user/protected/route.ts` — updated to use new API

**6. fetchSession NextAuth provider allows session creation with email only (no password)**
- Documented as risk — removing requires migration planning. Flagged for Phase 19.

**7. Stripe webhook creates guest users with hardcoded "guset-user" password**
- `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` — now generates cryptographically random password for guest accounts

### High Security Fixes (6)

**1. Change password endpoint had no session authentication**
- `src/app/api/user/change-password/route.ts` — uses session email, not request body email
- `src/app/api/user/change-password/schema.ts` — removed `email` field
- `src/components/User/AccountSettings/PasswordChange.tsx` — removed email from request

**2. API key delete had no ownership verification**
- `src/app/api/api-key/delete/route.ts` — verifies `apiKey.userId === session.user.id` before deleting
- `src/actions/api-key.ts` — server action deleteApiKey also checks ownership

**3. User delete authorization was checking target user's role instead of session user's role**
- `src/app/api/user/delete/route.ts` — fixed: checks `session.user.role === "ADMIN"` not `targetUser.role`

**4. User fetch endpoint was public, leaked subscription info for any email**
- `src/app/api/user/fetch-user/route.ts` — now requires auth, returns only own data
- `src/libs/getUpdatedData.ts` — removed email parameter
- `src/stripe/StripeBilling/PriceItem.tsx` — updated caller
- `src/lemonSqueezy/LsBilling/Pricing.tsx` — updated caller

**5. Security headers missing**
- `next.config.js` — added X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, Referrer-Policy, HSTS, Permissions-Policy

**6. Admin layout had no role check (TODO comment only)**
- `src/app/app/admin/layout.tsx` — now checks session role === ADMIN, redirects to /app otherwise

### Medium Fixes (4)

**1. Email SMTP was configured with `secure: false`**
- `src/libs/email.ts` — port-aware TLS: port 465 uses implicit TLS, others use STARTTLS

**2. Password reset leaked user existence via 404 response**
- `src/app/api/forgot-password/reset/route.ts` — always returns success message regardless of user existence

**3. Rate limiting improved and applied to critical endpoints**
- `src/libs/limiter.ts` — added memory cleanup, `checkRateLimit()` helper, increased default limits
- Applied to: `/api/user/register` (5/min), `/api/forgot-password/reset` (3/min), `/api/forgot-password/update` (5/min)

**4. Stripe price-to-plan mapping hardcoded**
- Documented as risk — should be in PlatformConfig table. Flagged for Phase 19.

### Observability System (New)

**Error Tracking Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`):
- `PlatformError` model: errorType, message, stackTrace, endpoint, method, statusCode, userId, userEmail, organizationId, requestBody (sanitized), correlationId, severity, resolved, createdAt
- Indexed on: (errorType, createdAt), (endpoint, createdAt), (severity, resolved, createdAt)

**Error Tracker Library** (`src/libs/error-tracker.ts`):
- `trackError(error, context)` — fire-and-forget error persistence
- `withErrorTracking(handler, routeInfo)` — API route wrapper with automatic error capture
- Sanitizes sensitive fields (password, token, apiKey, secret, credit_card, ssn) before storage
- Never lets tracking failures propagate to callers

**Admin API** (`src/app/api/admin/errors/route.ts`):
- `GET` — list errors with filtering (severity, resolved, endpoint, errorType) + pagination + grouped summary
- `PATCH` — bulk resolve errors by IDs
- `DELETE` — purge errors older than N days (default 14)
- All endpoints require ADMIN role

**Admin Dashboard** (`src/app/app/admin/errors/page.tsx`):
- Error type summary cards (top 4 by frequency)
- Filterable list: severity, resolved status, endpoint search
- Expandable detail view: stack trace, sanitized request body, user/org context, correlation ID
- Bulk resolve and purge controls
- Pagination for large error sets

**Sidebar Updated** (`src/components/app/AppSidebar.tsx`):
- Added "Error Tracking" nav item under admin section
- Added "Platform Config" nav item

### SEO Basics

**`src/app/robots.ts`** — disallows /api/, /app/, /admin/, /user/, /studio/; links to sitemap
**`src/app/sitemap.ts`** — static sitemap with homepage, blog, support, auth pages
**`src/app/(site)/page.tsx`** — updated metadata from "SaaSBold Demo" to proper Vestigio branding

### Files Created (6)
- `src/libs/error-tracker.ts` — error tracking library
- `src/app/api/admin/errors/route.ts` — admin error API (GET/PATCH/DELETE)
- `src/app/app/admin/errors/page.tsx` — admin error dashboard UI
- `src/app/robots.ts` — SEO robots.txt
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` — SEO sitemap

### Files Modified (23)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — added PlatformError model
- `next.config.js` — security headers
- `src/libs/auth.ts` — (documented fetchSession risk)
- `src/libs/email.ts` — TLS configuration
- `src/libs/limiter.ts` — improved rate limiter with cleanup + checkRateLimit()
- `src/libs/isValidAPIKey.ts` — complete rewrite for proper key validation
- `src/libs/getUpdatedData.ts` — removed email param
- `src/libs/error-tracker.ts` — new
- `src/app/api/forgot-password/update/route.ts` — token verification
- `src/app/api/forgot-password/update/schema.ts` — added token field
- `src/app/api/forgot-password/reset/route.ts` — rate limiting + no user enumeration
- `src/app/api/api-key/generate/route.ts` — auth + random keys
- `src/app/api/api-key/generate/schema.ts` — removed email
- `src/app/api/api-key/delete/route.ts` — ownership check
- `src/app/api/generate-content/route.ts` — auth + no user-supplied API key
- `src/app/api/paddle/cancel-subscription/route.ts` — auth + ownership
- `src/app/api/paddle/change-plan/route.ts` — auth + ownership
- `src/app/api/lemon-squeezy/cancel-subscription/route.ts` — auth + ownership
- `src/app/api/user/change-password/route.ts` — session auth
- `src/app/api/user/change-password/schema.ts` — removed email
- `src/app/api/user/delete/route.ts` — fixed authorization logic
- `src/app/api/user/fetch-user/route.ts` — session auth, returns own data only
- `src/app/api/user/register/route.ts` — rate limiting
- `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` — random guest password
- `src/app/api/example/admin/protected/route.ts` — updated API key validation
- `src/app/api/example/user/protected/route.ts` — updated API key validation
- `src/actions/api-key.ts` — random keys + ownership check
- `src/components/Auth/ResetPassword/index.tsx` — sends token
- `src/components/User/AccountSettings/PasswordChange.tsx` — removed email
- `src/stripe/StripeBilling/PriceItem.tsx` — updated getUpdatedData call
- `src/lemonSqueezy/LsBilling/Pricing.tsx` — updated getUpdatedData call
- `src/app/app/admin/layout.tsx` — server-side role check
- `src/app/app/admin/errors/page.tsx` — new error dashboard
- `src/app/(site)/page.tsx` — Vestigio metadata
- `src/components/app/AppSidebar.tsx` — added Error Tracking + Platform Config nav

### Remaining Gaps (Phase 19)
- `fetchSession` NextAuth provider still allows email-only authentication — needs migration plan to remove safely
- Stripe price-to-plan mapping hardcoded — should move to PlatformConfig table
- Rate limiting is in-memory only — needs Redis/Upstash for multi-instance production
- CSRF token validation not explicitly verified on custom POST routes (NextAuth provides some protection)
- No email verification before account creation (registration creates account immediately)
- Impersonation sessions in-memory only — no audit persistence
- `prisma migrate dev` needed to create PlatformError table
- No JSON-LD structured data for rich snippets
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration depends on DNS — documented as required

---

## Phase 17.5 — 2026-03-28 — Production Hardening & Wiring

### What was implemented
All SaaS access configuration is now persisted in the database, the Data Sources UI is fully wired to backend APIs, MCP reads real persisted data, the authenticated runtime uses stored configuration, and secrets are handled securely with production guards. The system survives restarts and is deployable to staging.

### Persistence Implementation

**`PrismaSaasAccessStore`** (`apps/platform/saas-access-store.ts`):
- Full Prisma-backed implementation alongside existing `InMemorySaasAccessStore`
- `get()` → `findUnique` by `environmentId`
- `save()` → `upsert` (create or update, one config per environment)
- `updateStatus()` → atomic status transition with failure reason tracking
- `markVerified()` → sets `lastVerifiedAt` and clears failure reason
- `delete()` → safe delete with boolean return
- Maps Prisma row ↔ domain `SaasAccessConfig` via `toConfig()` helper

**Store interface changed to async** — all methods now return `Promise`. Both `InMemorySaasAccessStore` and `PrismaSaasAccessStore` implement the same async `SaasAccessStore` interface. All callers updated to `await`.

**Store enforcement** (`apps/platform/store-enforcement.ts`):
- `initializeStores()` now initializes `PrismaSaasAccessStore` in production alongside existing `PrismaUsageStore`
- Development/test mode uses `InMemorySaasAccessStore`

### API Layer (`src/app/api/data-sources/saas/route.ts`)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/data-sources/saas?environment_id=...` | Read config (public view only) |
| `POST` | `/api/data-sources/saas` | Create/update config (upsert) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/data-sources/saas?environment_id=...` | Remove config |

**Security:**
- Authentication required via `isAuthorized()`
- Environment-to-organization ownership verified via `Membership` table
- Passwords encrypted on save via `encryptSecret()`, never stored as plaintext
- Existing password preserved if new password not provided (no re-entry required)
- Response always returns `SaasAccessPublicView` — never exposes `password_encrypted`
- Zod input validation for all fields

### UI → Backend Wiring (`src/app/app/settings/data-sources/page.tsx`)

- `useEffect` → `GET /api/data-sources/saas` on mount to load persisted state
- Form submit → `POST /api/data-sources/saas` with all fields
- Refetch after save to confirm persisted state
- Loading states, error states with user-visible messages
- Password field: never pre-filled; shows "leave blank to keep" when password exists
- Status badge reflects real DB status including `awaiting_manual_mfa`
- Shows `lastVerifiedAt` timestamp and `lastFailureReason` when applicable

### Secret Handling Hardening (`apps/platform/secret-service.ts`)

- **Production guard**: `enforceProductionSecrets()` — throws if `VESTIGIO_SECRET_KEY` missing in production
- **`encryptSecret()` in production**: throws if key not configured (no silent fallback)
- Dev/test fallback (base64) only works when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`
- All API responses sanitized through `toPublicView()` — no secret leakage possible

### Structured Auth Logging (`apps/platform/auth-logging.ts`)

- `AuthLogEntry` type with: `timestamp`, `level`, `event`, `environment_id`, `correlation_id`, `outcome`, `duration_ms`, `message`
- 9 event types: `auth_attempt_started`, `auth_attempt_success`, `auth_attempt_failed`, `auth_mfa_detected`, `auth_prerequisite_blocked`, `auth_runtime_error`, `auth_config_saved`, `auth_config_deleted`, `auth_status_updated`
- `createAuthLogger(environmentId)` — scoped logger with auto-generated `correlation_id`
- Query APIs: `getAuthLogs()`, `getAuthLogsByCorrelation()`, `clearAuthLogs()`
- Executor now logs all auth attempts with correlation IDs
- **No sensitive data in logs** — verified by test

### Runtime Integration

- `AuthenticatedJourneyExecutor.execute()` now fully async:
  - `await store.get(envId)` — reads from DB
  - `await store.updateStatus(...)` — persists status transitions to DB
  - Auth logger tracks full attempt lifecycle with correlation ID
- Status transitions persisted: `verified`, `failed`, `awaiting_manual_mfa`

### Data Consistency

- Environment → Organization ownership enforced at API level
- `verifyEnvironmentAccess()` checks `Membership` table for every API call
- No cross-organization data leakage possible
- Multi-environment isolation verified by test

### Files Created (3)
- `src/app/api/data-sources/saas/route.ts` — CRUD API with auth + validation
- `apps/platform/auth-logging.ts` — structured auth event logging
- `tests/production-wiring.test.ts` — 32 tests, 9 suites

### Files Modified (7)
- `apps/platform/saas-access-store.ts` — async interface + `PrismaSaasAccessStore`
- `apps/platform/store-enforcement.ts` — wires `PrismaSaasAccessStore` in production
- `apps/platform/secret-service.ts` — production guard + no-plaintext enforcement
- `apps/platform/index.ts` — new exports
- `workers/verification/executors.ts` — async store calls + auth logging
- `src/app/app/settings/data-sources/page.tsx` — fully wired to API
- `tests/saas-auth-runtime.test.ts` — updated for async store interface

### Remaining Gaps
- Prisma migration not yet run (`npx prisma migrate dev` needed for `SaasAccessConfig` table)
- Environment ID selection in Data Sources UI uses query param placeholder (needs real org/env context)
- Credit consumption check not yet enforced in `AuthenticatedJourneyExecutor` (credit system is in-memory)
- Auth logs are in-memory only (sufficient for current phase, can be backed by DB later)

### Tests
**19 test files total. 32 new tests across 9 suites, zero regression:**
- Async Store — CRUD Operations (8 tests)
- Multi-Environment Isolation (3 tests)
- Secret Handling Hardening (4 tests)
- Structured Auth Logging (4 tests)
- Executor — Async Store Integration (3 tests)
- MCP — Reads Persisted Data (5 tests)
- API Response — Public View Only (1 test)
- Store — Upsert Semantics (2 tests)
- Prerequisite Engine — Real Store Data (2 tests)

## Phase 17B — 2026-03-27 — Authenticated Journey Runtime

### What was implemented
Vestigio can now persist SaaS access configuration, attempt real authenticated browser sessions, handle MFA/blocked states explicitly, and produce first-class typed evidence from authenticated execution. Users manage data sources through an extensible Settings → Data Sources surface, and SaaS setup is offered as an optional, skippable step during onboarding.

After this phase, Vestigio can say:
- "Your SaaS authenticated access is configured"
- "I attempted authenticated verification"
- "I was blocked by MFA / missing setup / failed auth"
- "Here is structured evidence of that outcome"

### Persistence (`apps/platform/saas-access-store.ts`)
- `SaasAccessStore` interface: `get()`, `save()`, `updateStatus()`, `markVerified()`, `delete()`
- `InMemorySaasAccessStore` implementation with singleton accessor
- One active config per environment, explicit status transitions
- Prisma model `SaasAccessConfig` added to schema with all fields

### Secure Credential Handling (`apps/platform/secret-service.ts`)
- AES-256-GCM encryption with `VESTIGIO_SECRET_KEY` env var
- Versioned ciphertext format: `v1:<iv>:<tag>:<ciphertext>`
- Dev/test fallback: base64 encoding (logged as non-production)
- `encryptSecret()`, `decryptSecret()`, `isEncrypted()`, `isProductionEncryption()`
- `SaasAccessPublicView` type: never exposes `password_encrypted`, only `has_password: boolean`

### Domain Model Updates (`packages/domain/saas-access.ts`)
- `SaasAccessConfig` extended with: `has_trial`, `requires_seed_data`, `test_account_available`, `activation_goal`, `primary_upgrade_path`, `last_failure_reason`
- New status: `awaiting_manual_mfa` added to `SaasAccessStatus`
- `toPublicView()` — safe projection that strips secrets
- `createDefaultSaasAccessConfig()` updated with all new fields

### Data Sources Settings (`src/app/app/settings/data-sources/page.tsx`)
- Card-based extensible layout for all data sources
- Initial cards: SaaS Authenticated Access (configurable), Pixel (status), Stripe (coming soon), Shopify (coming soon)
- SaaS card expands to full configuration form: login URL, email, password, auth method, MFA, test account, trial, seed data, activation goal, upgrade path
- Old `/app/settings/saas-access` redirects to Data Sources
- Sidebar updated: "SaaS Access" → "Data Sources"

### Optional Onboarding Step (`src/app/(console)/onboard/page.tsx`)
- Dynamic step count: 5 steps for non-SaaS, 6 for SaaS (adds `saas_setup` step)
- SaaS step clearly marked as optional
- "Skip for now" button stores skip status
- Skipped setup surfaces in Data Sources settings
- Review step shows SaaS config status (configured / skipped / not configured)
- Onboarding completion succeeds without authenticated setup

### Authenticated Journey Runtime (`workers/verification/authenticated-runtime.ts`)

**Outcome states (explicit, never ambiguous):**

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `authenticated_success` | Login succeeded, navigated past login wall |
| `authentication_failed` | Credentials invalid or login form still present after submit |
| `awaiting_manual_mfa` | MFA challenge detected — paused for manual action |
| `blocked_by_prerequisite` | Prerequisites not met (missing URL, credentials, etc.) |
| `blocked_by_seed_data` | Test account needs seed data before analysis |
| `runtime_error` | Playwright unavailable or unexpected error |

**Real Playwright execution:**
- Navigates to login URL
- Detects login form via heuristic selectors (email/password/submit)
- Fills credentials (decrypted through SecretService)
- Submits form
- Detects MFA via 10+ indicator selectors
- Evaluates post-login state (still on login → failed; navigated away → success)
- One browser context per request, no session reuse

**Simulated execution:**
- Used in tests/CI when Playwright unavailable
- Deterministic outcomes based on config state
- `setAuthPlaywrightMode('simulated')` for test control

### `AuthenticatedJourneyExecutor` — Now Live
- Loads `SaasAccessConfig` from store by environment ID
- Validates prerequisites before execution
- Dispatches to real or simulated runtime
- Updates access config status based on outcome (verified / failed / awaiting_manual_mfa)
- Registered in orchestrator

### Evidence Generation
Evidence types prepared in 17A are now actively generated:
- `AuthenticatedSessionAttempt` — every login attempt (success or failure)
- `AuthenticationBlockedEvent` — when MFA or other blocker detected
- `PrerequisiteMissingEvent` — when prerequisites prevent execution
- `BrowserNavigationTrace` — on successful login (post-login URL + redirect chain)

All evidence includes: `subject_ref`, `scoping`, `cycle_ref`, `freshness`, `source_kind`, `collection_method`, `quality_score`.

### MCP Integration (`apps/mcp/saas-awareness.ts`)
- `composeAuthOutcomeAnswer()` — structured MCP answer for each outcome
- `describeSaasAccessStatus()` — human-readable status description
- All navigation points to Settings → Data Sources (not SaaS Access)
- Suggestions include retry, fix, or continue actions

### Files Created (5)
- `apps/platform/saas-access-store.ts` — persistence store
- `apps/platform/secret-service.ts` — encryption boundary
- `workers/verification/authenticated-runtime.ts` — authenticated execution engine
- `src/app/app/settings/data-sources/page.tsx` — Data Sources UI
- `tests/saas-auth-runtime.test.ts` — 40 tests, 13 suites

### Files Modified (11)
- `packages/domain/saas-access.ts` — extended with new fields + public view
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — added `SaasAccessConfig` model
- `workers/verification/executors.ts` — executor upgraded from stub to live
- `workers/verification/index.ts` — new exports
- `apps/platform/index.ts` — new exports
- `apps/mcp/index.ts` — new exports
- `apps/mcp/saas-awareness.ts` — runtime-aware answers
- `src/app/(console)/onboard/page.tsx` — dynamic SaaS step + skip
- `src/app/app/settings/saas-access/page.tsx` — redirect to Data Sources
- `src/components/app/AppSidebar.tsx` — Data Sources nav item
- `src/components/console/ConsoleState.tsx` — Data Sources link
- `tests/saas-auth-foundation.test.ts` — updated assertion

### What Remains for SaaS Pack
- SaaS-specific decision pack (onboarding quality, activation rate, churn signals)
- SaaS findings in Analysis surface
- Autonomous in-app exploration after successful login
- SaaS revenue impact engine (expansion/churn/upsell scoring)
- Landing ↔ app mismatch reasoning
- Deep journey analysis (onboarding funnel, activation checkpoints)
- Real Prisma-backed SaasAccessStore for production

### Known Limitations
- Credential encryption uses dev fallback (base64) when `VESTIGIO_SECRET_KEY` is not set
- Login form detection is heuristic-based (10+ selectors) — may miss unusual forms
- MFA detection is pattern-based — CAPTCHA detection not yet implemented
- No TOTP auto-fill — MFA always pauses for manual completion
- SaasAccessStore is in-memory only — PrismaStore not yet wired
- Data Sources UI saves locally only — no backend API wiring yet

### Tests
**18 test files total. 40 new tests across 13 suites, zero regression:**
- SaaS Access Store — CRUD (9 tests)
- Secret Service (4 tests)
- Public View — No Secret Leaks (3 tests)
- Authenticated Runtime — Simulated Success (1 test)
- Authenticated Runtime — MFA Handling (2 tests)
- Authenticated Runtime — Blocked by Prerequisites (2 tests)
- AuthenticatedJourneyExecutor — Simulated Mode (2 tests)
- MCP — Auth Outcome Answers (4 tests)
- MCP — SaaS Access Status Description (5 tests)
- MCP — Setup Answer Points to Data Sources (1 test)
- Evidence Types for Auth Runtime (2 tests)
- Onboarding Skip Flow (3 tests)
- Domain Model — SaaS Access Config (2 tests)

## Phase 17A — 2026-03-27 — SaaS Authenticated Foundation (No Execution)

### What changed
Vestigio now understands SaaS targets: what they are, how to access them, what's missing before analysis can begin. This is a **modeling + gating** phase — NO authenticated crawling, NO login automation, NO SaaS findings or pack yet.

After this phase, Vestigio can say: *"I understand your SaaS, but I cannot analyze it yet because you are missing X."*

### Models Created

**BusinessProfile extended** (`packages/domain/workspace.ts`):
- New `SaasProfile` interface added as optional `saas` field on `BusinessProfile`
- Fields: `is_saas`, `app_login_url`, `auth_method`, `mfa_mode`, `has_trial`, `activation_goal`, `primary_upgrade_path`, `requires_seed_data`, `test_account_available`
- Types: `SaasAuthMethod` (`password | oauth | magic_link | unknown`), `SaasMfaMode` (`none | optional | required | unknown`)
- Fully backward compatible — `saas: null` means non-SaaS (default)

**SaasAccessConfig** (`packages/domain/saas-access.ts`):
- Per-environment config: `login_url`, `email`, `password_encrypted` (marked sensitive, encryption NOT implemented yet)
- Status state machine: `unconfigured → configured → verified → expired/failed`
- `createDefaultSaasAccessConfig(environmentId)` factory

### Prerequisite Engine (`apps/platform/saas-prerequisites.ts`)

**`evaluateSaasPrerequisites(config, businessProfile) → SaasPrerequisiteState`**

Returns `{ status, missing_items, warnings, next_actions }` where:
- `status: 'ready' | 'partial' | 'blocked'`
- `missing_items`: typed enum — `missing_login_url`, `missing_credentials`, `missing_test_account`, `mfa_required`, `seed_data_required`, `missing_activation_goal`, `missing_auth_method`, `access_expired`, `access_failed`, `not_saas`

**Blockers** (prevent analysis entirely): `missing_login_url`, `missing_credentials`, `mfa_required`, `access_failed`, `not_saas`
**Non-blockers** (partial state): `missing_auth_method`, `seed_data_required`, `missing_activation_goal`, `missing_test_account`, `access_expired`

Also exports: `isSaasEnvironment()`, `formatPrerequisiteSummary()`

### Verification Type

- Added `VerificationType.AuthenticatedJourneyVerification = 'authenticated_journey_verification'`
- `AuthenticatedJourneyExecutor` registered in orchestrator — returns `status: 'failed'` with `not_ready` error
- Validation updated to accept the new type

### MCP Integration (`apps/mcp/saas-awareness.ts`)

- `buildSaasChecklist()` → structured checklist with 9 items (SaaS profile, login URL, auth method, credentials, MFA, test account, activation goal, seed data, access verified)
- `composeSaasSetupAnswer()` → returns MCP-formatted answer when setup is incomplete, null when ready or non-SaaS
- `canRequestAuthenticatedVerification()` → gate check before requesting authenticated verification

When SaaS is detected and incomplete:
- MCP answers guide user to complete setup
- Verification requests are blocked
- Suggestions point to SaaS Access settings

### Evidence Types (defined, no collection)

Three new `EvidenceType` values:
- `AuthenticatedSessionAttempt` — future: records login attempt results
- `AuthenticationBlockedEvent` — future: records why auth was blocked (MFA, captcha, IP block, rate limit)
- `PrerequisiteMissingEvent` — future: records what was missing when analysis was attempted

Payload interfaces defined in `packages/domain/evidence.ts`.

### Control Plane UI

- `/app/settings/saas-access` page — simple forms for login URL, email, auth method, MFA, test account, trial, seed data, activation goal, upgrade path
- "SaaS Access" link added to Control Plane sidebar section
- Phase 17A: UI shell only — no backend wiring yet

### Workspace/Analysis Integration

- `DataState<T>` extended with `saas_setup_required` status variant
- `ConsoleState` component renders structured checklist with progress indicator, blocking items, and link to SaaS Access settings

### What is NOT implemented

- Login automation / credential injection
- Playwright runtime modifications
- Real authenticated browser flows
- SaaS-specific findings or inference pack
- Impact computation for SaaS
- Credential encryption
- Backend API for SaaS access config persistence

### Tests

**17 test files, 44 new tests across 12 suites**, zero regression:
- SaaS Detection (5 tests)
- Prerequisite Engine — Ready (2 tests)
- Prerequisite Engine — Missing Items (9 tests)
- Prerequisite Engine — Warnings (3 tests)
- SaaS Access Config (2 tests)
- Authenticated Journey Verification Type (3 tests)
- MCP SaaS Awareness — Checklist (3 tests)
- MCP SaaS Awareness — Setup Answer (4 tests)
- MCP SaaS Awareness — Verification Gating (3 tests)
- SaaS Evidence Types (3 tests)
- Prerequisite Summary Formatting (3 tests)
- Backward Compatibility (4 tests)

## v4.1 — 2026-03-27 — Real Playwright Runtime

### What changed
The simulated browser execution in `BrowserWorker` is upgraded to real Playwright-based execution. The architecture is unchanged — only the execution layer is replaced. `PlaywrightRuntime` launches a real Chromium browser, executes verification steps, captures artifacts (screenshots, console errors, network failures, redirect chains), and returns structured results that feed into the existing evidence pipeline.

### PlaywrightRuntime (`workers/verification/playwright-runtime.ts`)

**Clean adapter** between VerificationStep types and real Playwright page operations:

| Step Type | Playwright Action |
|---|---|
| `navigate` | `page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' })` |
| `click` | `page.click(selector)` |
| `type` | `page.fill(selector, value)` |
| `wait_for` | `page.waitForSelector(selector, { timeout })` |
| `assert_visible` | `page.isVisible(selector)` |
| `screenshot` | `page.screenshot({ path })` to temp dir |
| `wait_ms` | `setTimeout` (capped at 10s) |

**Artifact capture** via event listeners:
- `page.on('console')` → captures error-level messages
- `page.on('requestfailed')` → captures network failures with URL
- `page.on('response')` → tracks 3xx redirects
- `page.on('framenavigated')` → tracks URL changes, detects checkout/pay/cart URLs
- `page.url()` / `page.title()` → captures final state

**Browser lifecycle:** one browser per request, headless Chromium, isolated BrowserContext with custom viewport (1280x720) and user-agent, ignores HTTPS errors, closes safely in `finally` block.

**Step-level timeout:** 15s per step. Global timeout from `BROWSER_LIMITS.max_duration_ms` (60s).

### BrowserWorker Upgrade

**Dual-mode execution:**
- `auto` (default) — probes for Playwright availability, uses real browser if present
- `real` — forces Playwright (for production)
- `simulated` — forces simulation (for tests/CI without browser)

**`setPlaywrightMode(mode)`** — control function for tests.

**Architecture preserved:**
- `BrowserWorker.execute()` → same interface
- `resultToEvidence()` → unchanged
- `parseBrowserRequest()` → unchanged
- `buildResult()` → extracted as shared helper between real and simulated paths
- Evidence types, confidence delta, credit consumption → all unchanged

### Real Execution Flow

```
BrowserWorker.execute()
  → checkPlaywrightAvailable()
  → if real: executeWithPlaywright()
      → new PlaywrightRuntime()
      → runtime.executeScenario(scenario, targetUrl)
          → chromium.launch({ headless: true })
          → context.newPage()
          → attach listeners (console, network, navigation)
          → for each step: executeStep(page, step)
          → capture final state
          → browser.close()
      → merge results across scenarios
  → if simulated: executeSimulated() (unchanged fallback)
  → resultToEvidence() (unchanged)
  → return ExecutorOutput
```

### Test Coverage (`tests/playwright-runtime.test.ts` — 9 tests, 4 suites)
- **PlaywrightRuntime Module (2):** instantiation, options
- **Execution Mode Control (2):** forced simulated mode, checkout detection from URL
- **Real Playwright Execution (3):** navigation to example.com with screenshot capture, selector failure handling, step timeout enforcement
- **Evidence Integrity (2):** source_kind/collection_method verification, payload structure validation

### Dependencies Added
```
playwright  ← Programmatic browser automation library
```
Chromium installed via `npx playwright install chromium` (91 MiB headless shell).

### All 16 test suites pass. Zero regression.

### Files Added
```
workers/verification/playwright-runtime.ts  ← Real Playwright adapter
tests/playwright-runtime.test.ts            ← 9 runtime tests (real + simulated)
```

### Files Modified
```
workers/verification/browser-worker.ts  ← Dual-mode execution (real/simulated), PlaywrightRuntime integration
tests/verification.test.ts              ← Force simulated mode for test stability
```

## v4.0 — 2026-03-27 — Browser Verification

### What changed
Vestigio transforms from inference-based intelligence to evidence-verified intelligence. The stub `BrowserVerificationExecutor` is replaced with a real scenario-based worker that executes controlled browser steps, produces typed evidence (navigation traces, checkout confirmations, failure events), and feeds results back into the decision engine. Verification is credit-gated and plan-restricted.

### Verification Request Contract (`workers/verification/browser-types.ts`)

**BrowserVerificationRequest:**
```
{ type, subject_ref, environment_ref, decision_ref?,
  target: { url, path_scope?, intent }, scenarios[], priority, cost_estimate? }
```

**VerificationStep types:** `navigate`, `click`, `type`, `wait_for`, `assert_visible`, `screenshot`, `wait_ms`

**VerificationScenario:** `{ name, steps: VerificationStep[] }`

**Safety limits:** max 20 steps, 60s timeout, 10 screenshots, 5 scenarios, 2 retries

**Validation:** `validateBrowserRequest()` enforces all limits, rejects empty URL/scenarios

### Cost Estimation

```
base_cost (5) + steps × 1 + screenshots × 2 = total_estimated
```

`estimateVerificationCost(scenarios)` → `CreditCostEstimate`

### Credit System (`apps/platform/credits.ts`)

**Plan-included credits/month:** Vestigio: 0 | Pro: 50 | Max: 200
**Max plan** can purchase additional credits via `addPurchasedCredits()`

| Function | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `getCreditBalance(orgId, plan)` | plan_included + purchased - consumed = available |
| `canAffordVerification(orgId, plan, cost)` | checks plan gating + balance |
| `consumeCredits(orgId, amount)` | deducts from balance |
| `addPurchasedCredits(orgId, amount)` | adds purchased credits (Max only) |

**Plan gating:**
- Vestigio: blocked entirely ("requires Pro or Max")
- Pro: limited to included credits, suggests Max for more
- Max: included + purchasable

### Browser Worker (`workers/verification/browser-worker.ts`)

**Replaces the stub** `BrowserVerificationExecutor` with real `BrowserWorker`:

1. Parses request into scenarios
2. Executes steps sequentially with timeout enforcement
3. Captures artifacts (screenshots, console errors, network errors)
4. Observes redirect chains, final URL, checkout detection
5. Converts results to **typed evidence**
6. Computes confidence delta: success +15, partial +5, failed -10

**Simulated execution** in dev/test — in production, swap step execution for real Playwright page operations.

### Browser Evidence Types (4 new)

| EvidenceType | Payload | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `browser_navigation_trace` | start_url, final_url, redirect_chain, steps, duration, title | Full navigation proof |
| `browser_checkout_confirmation` | checkout_url, confirmed, method | "We proved checkout works" |
| `browser_failure_event` | url, failed_steps, console_errors, network_errors | "We proved this is broken" |
| `browser_redirect_chain` | chain, final_url, crosses_domain | Redirect behavior proof |

All evidence has:
- `source_kind: 'browser_verification'`
- `collection_method: 'dynamic_render'`
- `quality_score` based on result (85 success, 60 partial, 30 failed)
- `freshness_state: Fresh` with 24h TTL

### Decision Engine Integration

Browser evidence flows through the existing pipeline:
- `recomputeAll()` processes browser evidence alongside static evidence
- `assembleContext()` includes browser evidence in MCP context
- Decisions upgrade confidence when browser evidence confirms observations
- Failed browser verifications can trigger incidents

### MCP Integration

Existing `verify()` on McpServer now executes real browser verification:
```
server.verify({ verification_type: 'browser_verification', subject_ref, reason })
→ creates request → dispatches to BrowserWorker → evidence → recompute
```

### Test Coverage (`tests/browser-verification.test.ts` — 23 tests, 6 suites)
- **Request Validation (5):** valid passes, empty scenarios, too many scenarios, too many steps, missing URL
- **Cost Estimation (2):** correct formula, more steps = higher cost
- **Credit System (8):** zero for vestigio, pro included, max highest, vestigio blocked, pro within limit, pro blocked exceeding, max purchasable, consume reduces
- **Browser Worker (3):** executes + produces evidence, navigation trace present, correct source_kind
- **MCP Integration (2):** server creates request, orchestrator produces evidence
- **Plan Gating (3):** vestigio blocked, pro allowed, max + purchased allowed

### Total: 15 test files, all passing. Zero regression. `verification.test.ts` updated (stub test → real execution test).

### Files Added
```
workers/verification/browser-types.ts    ← Request contract, scenarios, steps, cost estimation, safety limits
workers/verification/browser-worker.ts   ← BrowserWorker executor + evidence conversion
apps/platform/credits.ts                 ← Credit system (balance, deduction, plan gating)
tests/browser-verification.test.ts       ← 23 browser verification tests
```

### Files Modified
```
packages/domain/enums.ts                 ← 4 new EvidenceType values (browser_*)
packages/domain/evidence.ts              ← 4 new payload types + union extension
workers/verification/executors.ts        ← Stub replaced with real BrowserWorker re-export
tests/verification.test.ts              ← Updated stub test → real execution test
```

## v3.1 — 2026-03-27 — Route Unification

### What changed
Three parallel authenticated shells (`/(console)`, `/user`, `/admin`) unified into one product shell under `/app`. Zero product page rewrites — surfaces rehomed via re-export. One sidebar, one navigation model, one layout.

### Route Model
**Product:** `/app/analysis`, `/app/chat`, `/app/actions`, `/app/workspaces`, `/app/maps`
**Control Plane:** `/app/organization`, `/app/billing`, `/app/members`, `/app/settings`, `/app/onboarding`
**Platform Admin:** `/app/admin/overview`, `/app/admin/organizations`, `/app/admin/users`, `/app/admin/environments`, `/app/admin/usage-billing`, `/app/admin/pricing`, `/app/admin/system-health`, `/app/admin/platform-config`

### Unified Shell
- `AppSidebar` — 3 sections (Product, Control Plane, Platform Admin), all `/app/` paths, admin conditionally shown
- `/app/layout.tsx` — single authenticated layout with OrgSelector + sidebar
- `/app/admin/layout.tsx` — admin sub-layout guard

### Legacy Redirects (middleware)
`/user` → `/app` | `/admin` → `/app/admin/overview` (admin) or `/app` | `/analysis` → `/app/analysis` | etc.

### RBAC
- `/app/*` — any authenticated user
- `/app/admin/*` — platform ADMIN only (User.role, not Membership.role)
- Org owner ≠ platform admin

### Files: 23 added (pages + sidebar + tests), 1 modified (middleware). All 14 test suites pass.

## v3.0 — 2026-03-27 — Production Lock

### What changed
Vestigio is locked for production deployment. No optional infrastructure. No silent fallbacks. Every startup validates env, enforces store configuration, and fails fast if anything is missing. Full end-to-end smoke path verified: onboarding → checkout → MCP → findings → suggestions.

### Platform Bootstrap (`apps/platform/`)

#### Environment Validation (`env-validation.ts`)
Validates required env vars at startup. Crashes if missing in production.

**Required always:** `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`
**Required in production:** `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
**Recommended (warnings):** `SITE_URL`, `EMAIL_FROM`

- `validateEnv(env?)` → `{ valid, missing[], warnings[] }`
- `enforceEnv()` → crashes process if missing in production
- `isProduction()` → `NODE_ENV === 'production'`

#### Store Enforcement (`store-enforcement.ts`)
Prevents in-memory stores in production. One-time initialization.

- `initializeStores(prisma?)` — production requires Prisma client, dev uses in-memory
- `assertStoresReady()` — call before any MCP operation
- `validateStoreConfiguration()` → `{ valid, message }`
- **Production + InMemoryStore = THROW** — no accidental fallback
- **Double initialization = THROW** — no runtime store switching

#### Startup Sequence (`startup.ts`)
Single entry point for app init.

```typescript
const result = vestigioStartup(prisma?);
// { success: boolean, environment: string, checks: { name, passed, message }[] }
```

1. Validates environment variables
2. Initializes stores (Prisma or in-memory based on NODE_ENV)
3. Validates store configuration
4. Logs startup summary with pass/fail per check
5. Production: aborts if any check fails

### Audit Timeout Protection (`apps/mcp/audit-lifecycle.ts`)

Added to prevent audits stuck in "running" forever:

- `failStuckAudits(timeoutMs?)` — auto-fails cycles running longer than threshold (default 10 min)
- `getStuckAudits(timeoutMs?)` — identifies stuck cycles without modifying them
- Default timeout: 10 minutes
- In production: run periodically (cron or health check)

### Observability Upgrade (`apps/mcp/observability.ts`)

**Correlation IDs:**
- `generateCorrelationId()` → `req_{timestamp}_{counter}` — unique per request
- Every log entry has `request_id` field
- `getLogsByRequestId(id)` — find all entries for one request
- `createMcpLogger().log()` auto-generates `request_id`

**Log Sink interface:**
```typescript
interface LogSink {
  write(entry: McpLogEntry): void;
}
```
- `MemoryLogSink` — default (capped at 1000)
- `addLogSink(sink)` — add external sinks (Datadog, file, DB)
- Multiple sinks supported — sink failure doesn't break MCP

**Enhanced stats:**
- `error_rate` — percentage with 2 decimal precision
- `p95_execution_ms` — 95th percentile latency

### Impersonation (`apps/platform/impersonation.ts`)

- `startImpersonation(adminUserId, targetUserId, targetOrgId?)` — creates session
- `endImpersonation(adminUserId)` — safe exit
- `getImpersonation(adminUserId)` — check active session
- `isImpersonating(adminUserId)` — boolean check
- **Double impersonation = THROW** — must exit first
- Session tracks: admin_user_id, impersonated_user_id, impersonated_org_id, started_at

### Pixel Management (`apps/platform/pixel-management.ts`)

- `generatePixelId(orgId, envId)` — deterministic (same inputs = same pixel)
- `generatePixelSnippet(pixelId)` — full HTML snippet with CDN reference
- `getPixelConfig(orgId, envId, domain)` → `{ org_id, env_id, domain, pixel_id, snippet, installed }`

### Seed Script (`prisma/seed.ts`)

Template for production DB initialization:
- Creates admin user from `ADMIN_EMAILS` env
- Creates default `PlatformConfig` entries (plan limits, credit pricing)
- Run with: `npx tsx prisma/seed.ts`

### Test Coverage (`tests/production-lock.test.ts` — 30 tests, 8 suites)

- **Environment Validation (6):** all vars present, missing DB URL, missing SECRET, production requires Stripe, production passes with all, recommended warnings
- **Store Enforcement (3):** dev mode init, double init throws, uninitialized detection
- **Startup Sequence (2):** succeeds with valid env, returns environment name
- **Audit Timeout Protection (3):** stuck audit detection, state machine enforcement, API availability
- **Observability Correlation (5):** unique IDs, request_id in logs, correlation query, auto-generation, enhanced stats
- **Impersonation (4):** start/end flow, double-impersonate throws, session retrieval, null when not impersonating
- **Pixel Management (4):** deterministic IDs, different orgs = different pixels, snippet content, full config
- **End-to-End Smoke Path (3):** full onboarding→MCP→findings flow, usage limit enforcement, maintenance mode blocking

### Total Test Count: 411 across 91 suites — ALL PASSING (13 test files)

## v2.2 — 2026-03-27 — Operations & Admin Control Plane

### What changed
Vestigio becomes fully operable with DB-backed usage persistence, audit lifecycle state machine, structured MCP observability, maintenance mode, and a complete admin panel for platform operators.

### Usage Persistence — DB-Backed (`apps/mcp/usage.ts`)

**UsageStore interface** — pluggable persistence:
```typescript
interface UsageStore {
  getUsageCount(orgId, period): Promise<number>;
  recordUsage(orgId, usageType, amount, period): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Two implementations:**
- `InMemoryUsageStore` — default for tests + engine (instance-scoped Map)
- `PrismaUsageStore` — inject with real Prisma client in production
  - `getUsageCount()` → `prisma.usage.aggregate({ _sum: { amount } })`
  - `recordUsage()` → `prisma.usage.create()`

**Dual-layer architecture:**
- In-memory cache for fast synchronous reads
- `incrementUsage()` writes to cache AND fires async DB write
- `loadUsageFromDb()` hydrates cache from DB on bootstrap
- `seedUsage()` pre-loads cache for session start
- `setUsageStore()` swaps implementation at runtime

### Audit Lifecycle (`apps/mcp/audit-lifecycle.ts`)

**State machine:** `pending → running → complete | failed`

Invalid transitions throw: `complete → running`, `failed → running`, `pending → complete`.

**AuditStore interface** — same pluggable pattern:
- `InMemoryAuditStore` — default
- `PrismaAuditStore` — inject in production

**Public API:**
| Function | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `triggerAudit(orgId, envId, type)` | Creates pending cycle |
| `startAudit(cycleId)` | pending → running |
| `completeAudit(cycleId)` | running → complete (sets completedAt) |
| `failAudit(cycleId)` | running → failed |
| `retryAudit(cycleId)` | Creates NEW pending cycle from failed (never mutates original) |
| `getLatestCycle(envId)` | Most recent cycle for environment |
| `getAuditHistory(envId)` | All cycles, newest first |

### MCP Observability (`apps/mcp/observability.ts`)

**Structured log entry:**
```typescript
{ timestamp, org_id, env_id, tool, success, execution_ms, usage_consumed, error, metadata }
```

**In-memory log buffer** (capped at 1000 entries):
- `logMcpCall(entry)` — append to buffer
- `createMcpLogger(orgId, envId)` — convenience logger factory

**Query API (admin panel):**
- `getRecentLogs(limit)` — newest first
- `getLogsByOrg(orgId)` — filtered by org
- `getErrorLogs()` — only failures
- `getLogStats()` → `{ total_calls, errors, avg_execution_ms, calls_today }`

**Debug mode:**
- `enableDebug(orgId)` / `enableGlobalDebug()` — outputs JSON to console
- Per-org opt-in, no global noise

### Maintenance Mode (`apps/mcp/maintenance.ts`)

- `setOrgMaintenance(orgId, enabled)` — blocks all MCP for org
- `setEnvMaintenance(envId, enabled)` — blocks specific environment
- `isInMaintenance(orgId, envId?)` — checks both org and env level
- Org maintenance blocks all envs for that org
- `clearAllMaintenance()` — admin reset

### Admin Panel — Operator Pages

4 new pages added to existing admin layout at `/admin/`:

| Page | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Organizations | `/admin/organizations` | All orgs with plan, status, env count, member count. Actions: view, suspend, impersonate |
| Environments | `/admin/environments` | All domains with audit status. Actions: trigger audit, maintenance, view findings |
| Usage & Billing | `/admin/usage-billing` | Per-org usage with limits and overages. Actions: grant credits, override limits |
| System Health | `/admin/system-health` | MCP calls today, error rate, avg latency, recent logs |

**Existing admin pages** enhanced:
- `/admin/pricing` — plan limits, MCP quotas, credit pricing (from v2.0)

**Admin sidebar** — 5 Vestigio-specific items added to existing `adminSidebarData`:
- Organizations, Environments, Usage & Billing, Pricing, System Health

### Admin Authorization

All admin routes protected by existing NextAuth middleware:
- `role === "ADMIN"` required
- Middleware at `/admin/:path*` redirects non-admins
- Existing impersonation infrastructure (from boilerplate CredentialsProvider) reused

### Test Coverage (`tests/operations.test.ts` — 28 tests, 4 suites)
- **Usage Persistence (9):** seed+get, seed+increment, from zero, per-org isolation, DB-writable record, summary with limits, blocks at limit, allows under, period format
- **Audit Lifecycle State Machine (8):** all valid transitions, all invalid transitions, skip-state rejection, terminal state enforcement
- **Observability (6):** log storage, newest-first ordering, error filtering, stats computation, logger factory, org filtering
- **Maintenance Mode (5):** org maintenance, env maintenance, removal, org blocks all envs, clearAll

### Total Test Count: 383 (100+36+25+35+19+20+17+31+28+24+20+28) across 83 suites — ALL PASSING

### Files Added
```
apps/mcp/audit-lifecycle.ts   ← Audit state machine + AuditStore interface

## v2.1 — 2026-03-27 — Production Hardening

### What changed
Vestigio is hardened to production-grade reliability. All demo data removed. Every UI page handles loading/empty/error/not_ready states explicitly. Bootstrap is deterministic. Usage tracking is persistence-ready. System never silently falls back to fake data.

### ZERO DEMO DATA
All hardcoded demo arrays removed from every console page:
- `demoFindings` — REMOVED from analysis/page.tsx
- `demoActions` — REMOVED from actions/page.tsx
- `demoWorkspaces` — REMOVED from workspaces/page.tsx
- `demoMaps` — REMOVED from maps/page.tsx
- `demoMessages` — REMOVED from chat/page.tsx
- `demoDomains` — REMOVED from settings/page.tsx

**Verification:** `grep -r "const demo" src/` returns zero matches.

### DataState<T> — Explicit State Machine

New type in `src/lib/console-data.ts`:
```typescript
type DataState<T> =
  | { status: 'loading' }
  | { status: 'ready'; data: T }
  | { status: 'empty' }
  | { status: 'error'; message: string }
  | { status: 'not_ready'; reason: string }
```

Every data loader returns `DataState<T>` — never null, never fake data:
- `loadFindings()` → `DataState<FindingProjection[]>`
- `loadActions()` → `DataState<ActionProjection[]>`
- `loadWorkspaces()` → `DataState<WorkspaceProjection[]>`
- `loadMap(type)` → `DataState<MapDefinition>`
- `loadAllMaps()` → `DataState<MapDefinition[]>`
- `loadAnswer(tool, params)` → `DataState<McpAnswer>`

### ConsoleState Component

New shared component `src/components/console/ConsoleState.tsx`:
- Renders loading spinner with label
- Renders "Not Ready" with link to onboarding
- Renders error with retry button
- Renders empty state with message
- Children render function only called when `status === 'ready'`

Used by: Analysis, Actions, Workspaces, Maps pages.

### Console Pages — Fully Data-Driven

All 6 console pages rewritten:

| Page | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Analysis | demoFindings array | `loadFindings()` → `ConsoleState` → `AnalysisContent` |
| Actions | demoActions array | `loadActions()` → `ConsoleState` → `ActionsContent` |
| Workspaces | demoWorkspaces array | `loadWorkspaces()` → `ConsoleState` → `WorkspacesContent` |
| Maps | demoMaps array | `loadAllMaps()` → `ConsoleState` → `MapsContent` |
| Chat | demoMessages array | `loadAnswer()` + preset questions + contextual entry |
| Settings | demoDomains array | Empty states with explanation text |

### Chat Page — Real MCP Integration

- **Empty state:** Shows preset question buttons (scale, revenue, cause, fix)
- **Question routing:** Maps user input keywords to MCP tools
- **Real answers:** All responses come from live MCP calls via `loadAnswer()`
- **Contextual entry:** `?finding=X` calls `discuss_finding`, `?findings=X,Y` calls `analyze_findings`
- **No hardcoded responses** — every answer is computed from engine pipeline

### Bootstrap Hardening

`apps/mcp/bootstrap.ts` rewritten with:
- **BootstrapResult type:** `{ status: 'ready', evidence_count, cycle_ref }` | `{ status: 'no_data', reason }` | `{ status: 'error', message }`
- **BootstrapError class** with typed error codes: `no_evidence | no_audit_cycle | ingestion_failed | invalid_input`
- **Deterministic cycle_ref:** `audit_cycle:{audit_cycle_id}` when provided, `audit_cycle:{org_id}_{env_id}` as fallback — same inputs always produce same ref
- **Empty evidence = explicit no_data** — never loads partial context
- **Missing required fields = explicit error** — never silently proceeds

### Usage Tracking — Persistence-Ready

`apps/mcp/usage.ts` upgraded:
- **`seedUsage(orgId, amount)`** — pre-loads cache from DB values on bootstrap
- **`getUsageRecord(orgId, usageType)`** — returns DB-writable record shape matching Prisma Usage model
- **`currentPeriod()`** — exposed for DB queries (YYYY-MM format)
- Cache serves as read-through layer; DB writes happen via caller

### Test Coverage (`tests/hardening.test.ts` — 20 tests, 6 suites)
- **MCP Without Context (4):** callTool errors, answer errors, discuss errors, getContext null
- **Bootstrap Determinism (5):** same inputs = same ref, different cycles = different refs, empty evidence = no_data, missing fields = error, evidence count tracked
- **Usage Persistence (4):** seedUsage loads cache, seed + increment, DB-writable record, period format
- **No Demo Data in Engine (2):** fresh server produces error (not fake data), bootstrapped server produces real computed data
- **Audit Lifecycle (2):** empty evidence rejected, switching env reloads context
- **Usage Enforcement Edge Cases (3):** exact limit blocked, one below allowed, max plan suggests credits

### Total Test Count: 355 (100+36+25+35+19+20+17+31+28+24+20) across 75 suites — ALL PASSING

### Files Added
```
src/components/console/ConsoleState.tsx  ← DataState renderer (loading/empty/error/not_ready)
tests/hardening.test.ts                 ← 20 production hardening tests

apps/mcp/bootstrap.ts                      ← BootstrapResult type, deterministic cycle_ref, explicit failure
apps/mcp/usage.ts                          ← seedUsage, getUsageRecord, currentPeriod, persistence interface
src/app/(console)/analysis/page.tsx         ← Zero demo data, uses ConsoleState + loadFindings()
src/app/(console)/actions/page.tsx          ← Zero demo data, uses ConsoleState + loadActions()
src/app/(console)/workspaces/page.tsx       ← Zero demo data, uses ConsoleState + loadWorkspaces()
src/app/(console)/maps/page.tsx             ← Zero demo data, uses ConsoleState + loadAllMaps()
src/app/(console)/chat/page.tsx             ← Zero demo data, real MCP answers, preset questions
src/app/(console)/settings/page.tsx         ← Zero demo data, empty states
```

### Hardening Guarantees

| Property | Guarantee |
|---|---|
| Demo data | Zero instances in `src/` |
| Invalid MCP state | Explicit error, never silent fallback |
| Empty evidence | BootstrapResult.no_data, context stays null |
| Missing bootstrap fields | BootstrapResult.error with message |
| Deterministic context | Same org+env+cycle → same output |
| Usage at limit | Blocked with upgrade message |
| UI without context | Shows "Not Ready" with onboarding link |
| UI with error | Shows error + retry button |
| UI with no data | Shows empty state with explanation |

## v2.0 — 2026-03-27 — SaaS Control Plane

### What changed
Vestigio transforms from a development-only engine into a deployable multi-tenant SaaS product with organizations, billing, usage metering, and real data flow — built on top of the existing NextAuth + Stripe + Prisma boilerplate.

### Prisma Schema Extension (7 new models)

| Model | Purpose | Key Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `Organization` | Tenant root | id, name, ownerId, plan (vestigio/pro/max), status (pending/active/suspended) |
| `Membership` | User ↔ Org link | userId, organizationId, role (owner/admin/member), unique(userId,organizationId) |
| `Environment` | Domain = environment | organizationId, domain, landingUrl, isProduction |
| `BusinessProfile` | Business context (1:1 org) | businessModel, monthlyRevenue, AOV, conversionModel |
| `AuditCycle` | Audit run tracking | organizationId, environmentId, status (pending/running/complete/failed), cycleType |
| `Usage` | MCP call metering | organizationId, usageType (mcp_chat/mcp_tool/credits), amount, period (YYYY-MM), indexed |
| `PlatformConfig` | Admin-configurable settings | configKey (unique), value (text) |

User model extended with `memberships: Membership[]` relation.

### New Package: `packages/plans/`

#### Plan Entitlements (`entitlements.ts`)

| Plan | MCP Calls/mo | Continuous Audits | Credits | Environments | Members |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vestigio ($99) | 50 | No | No | 1 | 1 |
| Pro ($199) | 250 | Yes | No | 3 | 3 |
| Max ($399) | 1000 | Yes | Yes | 10 | 10 |

**Functions:**
- `getPlanEntitlements(plan)` → full entitlements object
- `isPlanKey(value)` → type guard
- `planFromPriceId(stripeId)` → plan key from Stripe price
- `priceIdForPlan(plan)` → Stripe price ID
- `getAllPlans()` → all 3 plans

### New Module: `apps/mcp/usage.ts` — Usage Tracking

**In-memory usage store** (per org, per YYYY-MM period):
- `getUsage(orgId, period?)` → current count
- `incrementUsage(orgId, amount?)` → increment and return new count
- `getUsageSummary(orgId, plan)` → { used, limit, remaining, is_over_limit, period }
- `checkUsageLimit(orgId, plan)` → { allowed, summary, upgrade_message }
- `resetUsage(orgId)` / `resetAllUsage()` → testing helpers

**Enforcement:**
- Before every MCP call: `checkUsageLimit()`
- If over limit: returns upgrade message (suggests next tier)
- Vestigio → "Upgrade to Pro", Pro → "Upgrade to Max", Max → "Purchase credits"

### New Module: `apps/mcp/bootstrap.ts` — Context Bootstrap

Bridges persistence (Prisma) → in-memory engine (MCP Server):
- `bootstrapMcpContextSync(server, input, evidence)` — loads pre-fetched evidence
- `bootstrapMcpContext(server, input)` — runs async ingestion pipeline, then loads
- `extractDomain(url)` / `normalizeLandingUrl(url)` — URL utilities

**BootstrapInput:** organization_id, organization_name, environment_id, domain, landing_url, is_production, business_inputs?, existing_evidence?

### Onboarding Flow (5-step with Checkout)

**Step 1** → Organization name
**Step 2** → Domain (environment URL)
**Step 3** → Business context (type, revenue, AOV, conversion model)
**Step 4** → Review (all details summary)
**Step 5** → Choose plan + Checkout (3 plan cards with feature lists)

**API Route** (`/api/onboard`):
1. Validates input (Zod schema)
2. Creates Organization (status=pending)
3. Creates Environment
4. Creates BusinessProfile
5. Creates Stripe checkout session with metadata: `{ userId, organizationId, onboarding: "true" }`
6. Returns Stripe checkout URL

**On successful payment** (Stripe webhook enhanced):
1. Updates User with subscription
2. Activates Organization (status → active, plan from priceId)
3. Creates Membership (owner)
4. Creates initial AuditCycle
5. Redirects to `/analysis?onboarded=true`

### Stripe Webhook Enhancement

Added onboarding activation block to `checkout.session.completed`:
- Reads `metadata.onboarding`, `metadata.organizationId`, `metadata.userId`
- Maps priceId → plan via `mapPriceIdToPlan()`
- Updates Organization, creates Membership, creates AuditCycle
- All within existing webhook — no new endpoint

### Console Layout Upgrade

- **OrgSelector component** — shows current org + domain in top bar
- **Console layout** — added header with org selector + plan badge
- **Responsive** — works with existing Sidebar

### Middleware Extension

Protected routes now include all console paths:
```
/user/:path*, /admin/:path*,
/analysis/:path*, /actions/:path*, /workspaces/:path*,
/chat/:path*, /maps/:path*, /settings/:path*, /onboard/:path*
```

### Admin Pricing Config Page

New admin page at `/admin/pricing`:
- **Plan table** — edit price, MCP limit, environments, members, continuous audits, credits per plan
- **Credit pricing** — base cost per call, markup multiplier, effective price display
- **Save button** — (wired for production POST to /api/admin/pricing)

### Console Data Provider (`src/lib/console-data.ts`)

Bridge between UI pages and MCP:
- `loadFindings()` → FindingProjection[] | null
- `loadActions()` → ActionProjection[] | null
- `loadWorkspaces()` → WorkspaceProjection[] | null
- `loadMap(type)` → MapDefinition | null
- `isMcpLoaded()` → boolean

Returns null when MCP context not loaded (pages use demo data as fallback).

### Test Coverage (`tests/saas.test.ts` — 24 tests, 5 suites)

- **Plan Model (6):** entitlements for all plans, tier scaling, isPlanKey validation, Stripe price mapping, priceIdForPlan, getAllPlans
- **MCP Usage Tracking (8):** zero start, increment tracking, per-org isolation, summary with limits, blocks over limit, allows under limit, pro higher limit, reset
- **MCP Bootstrap (5):** loads context, produces projections, produces answers, extractDomain formats, normalizeLandingUrl
- **Usage + MCP Integration (2):** metered calls after bootstrap, limit blocks further calls
- **Server Org Context (3):** session tracks org, reset clears, full tool access after bootstrap

### Total Test Count: 335 (100+36+25+35+19+20+17+31+28+24) across 69 suites — ALL PASSING

## v1.2 — 2026-03-27 — Active Intelligence System

### What changed
MCP transforms from a passive Q&A interface into an active intelligence system that guides exploration, enables contextual finding discussion, supports multi-finding batch analysis, and provides proactive suggestions with every answer.

### New Module: `apps/mcp/session.ts` — Session Context

**McpSessionContext** tracks user exploration per session:
```
{
  active_workspace?: string
  selected_findings?: string[]
  selected_actions?: string[]
  last_viewed_map?: string
  exploration_state: {
    explored_packs: string[]
    explored_root_causes: string[]
    explored_maps: string[]
    asked_questions: string[]
  }
}
```

**Session Management Functions:**
- `createEmptySession()` — fresh session
- `markPackExplored()`, `markRootCauseExplored()`, `markMapExplored()`, `markQuestionAsked()` — tracking
- `setActiveWorkspace()`, `setSelectedFindings()`, `setSelectedActions()`, `setLastViewedMap()` — state

### New Module: `apps/mcp/questions.ts` — Next-Best-Question Engine

**`generateNextQuestions(session, projections, impactSummary)`** → `string[]` (max 5)

Considers:
1. Highest impact findings not yet explored
2. Packs not yet explored (with $ at stake)
3. Low confidence areas needing verification
4. Root causes not yet investigated
5. Maps not yet viewed
6. Cross-pack action opportunities
7. Verification suggestions for high-impact issues

**Avoids repetition** — tracks asked questions in session, filters them out.

**`generateFindingPrompts(finding)`** → 3 dynamic prompts:
- Always: "Why is X happening?" + "What's the fastest way to fix this?"
- Impact-based: "How much is this costing me exactly?" (if >$10k/mo)
- Root cause: "What else is caused by Y?" (if root cause exists)
- Pack-specific: "Will this get worse at scale?" / "How much revenue am I losing?" / "How does this affect chargeback rate?"
- Confidence-based: "Can we verify this with a live check?" (if <60%)

**`generateMultiFindingPrompts(findings, sharedRootCauses)`** → 3 prompts:
- "What should I fix first across these N issues?"
- "Are these caused by the same underlying issue?" / "Are any connected?"
- "Can one fix solve multiple problems?"

### New Module: `apps/mcp/suggestions.ts` — Suggestion Engine

**`buildSuggestions(ctx, session, domain)`** → `McpSuggestions`:
```
{
  questions: string[]    // next-best-questions from engine
  actions: string[]      // top 3 actions with $ saved
  navigation: {
    open_workspace?: string
    open_map?: string
    open_analysis?: boolean
    open_actions?: boolean
  }
}
```

Navigation targets vary by answer domain (scale → preflight + revenue map, revenue → revenue workspace, etc.)

**`buildFindingChatContext(findingId, projections)`** → `FindingChatContext`:
```
{
  finding_id, title, root_cause, impact, effect,
  severity, pack, suggested_prompts
}
```

**`buildMultiFindingContext(findingIds, projections)`** → `MultiFindingContext`:
- Computes combined impact (sum ranges)
- Detects shared root causes (root_cause appearing in 2+ selected findings)
- Analyzes relationships:
  - Shared root causes → "fixing X addresses them all"
  - Same pack compounding → "N issues compound within pack"
  - Same surface overlap → "N issues affect same surface — single fix point"

**`composeFindingAnswer()` / `composeMultiFindingAnswer()`** — compose structured answers for contextual chat

### New Types (`apps/mcp/types.ts`)

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `McpSuggestions` | questions[], actions[], navigation{} — attached to every answer |
| `McpContextualFocus` | finding? + multi_finding? — contextual chat state |
| `FindingChatContext` | Single finding discussion context with impact + prompts |
| `MultiFindingContext` | Multi-finding batch analysis with combined impact + relationships |
| `McpSessionContext` | Per-session exploration state tracking |

### McpAnswer Upgrade

**Two new fields on every McpAnswer:**
- `suggestions: McpSuggestions | null` — proactive next steps
- `contextual_focus: McpContextualFocus | null` — current chat focus

All 4 standard answer composers updated:
- `composeScaleReadinessAnswer(ctx, session?)` — suggestions with scale domain
- `composeRevenueIntegrityAnswer(ctx, session?)` — suggestions with revenue domain
- `composeRootCauseAnswer(ctx, session?)` — suggestions with root_cause domain
- `composeFixFirstAnswer(ctx, session?)` — suggestions with fix_first domain

**Two new answer composers:**
- `composeFindingChatAnswer(ctx, findingId, session?)` — single finding discussion
- `composeMultiFindingChatAnswer(ctx, findingIds, session?)` — batch finding analysis

### New MCP Tools (2)

| Tool | Input | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `discuss_finding` | `finding_id: string` | Contextual chat about a specific finding with impact analysis + prompts |

## v1.1 — 2026-03-26 — Project Intelligence into Product Surfaces

### What changed
All quantified intelligence is now visible, explorable, and actionable across every UI surface. The system transforms from "engine with a thin UI" to "every finding shows cause → effect → money."

### New Package: `/packages/projections`

#### Projection Types (`types.ts`)
- `FindingProjection` — id, title, root_cause, severity, confidence, quantified impact (monthly_range, midpoint, impact_type, percentage_delta), pack, surface, freshness, inference_key, reasoning, cause, effect, basis_type
- `ActionProjection` — id, title, description, root_cause, quantified impact (monthly_range, midpoint), confidence, cross_pack, priority_score, severity, action_type
- `WorkspaceProjection` — id, name, type (preflight/revenue/chargeback), pack_key, decision_key, decision_impact, summary (total_loss_range, total_loss_mid, top_issues, confidence, issue_count), scoped findings
- `ProjectionResult` — findings[], actions[], workspaces[]

#### Projection Engine (`engine.ts`)
- `projectAll(result)` → `ProjectionResult`
- `projectFindings(result)` → findings sorted by impact midpoint descending
- `projectActions(result)` → actions sorted by impact → confidence → severity
- `projectWorkspaces(result, findings?)` → 3 workspace projections with scoped findings

**Inference → Pack Mapping:**
16 inference keys mapped to primary pack (scale_readiness, revenue_integrity, chargeback_resilience)

**Inference → Surface Mapping:**
Each inference mapped to a typical page surface (/checkout, /policies, /contact, etc.)

**Action Impact Computation:**
action → root_cause → contributing_inferences → value_cases → sum impact

**Priority Score Formula:**
```
priority_score = impact_midpoint × (confidence/100) × cross_pack_multiplier
```

### New Package: `/packages/maps`

#### Map Types (`types.ts`)
- `MapNode` — id, type (root_cause/finding/action/checkout/support/policy/trust/measurement), label, severity, impact, pack, metadata, position
- `MapEdge` — id, source, target, type (causal/transition/contributes_to/addresses), label
- `MapDefinition` — id, name, type, nodes[], edges[]

#### Map Engine (`engine.ts`)
- `buildRevenueLeakageMap(projections, result)` — root causes (left) → findings (right) with impact badges
- `buildChargebackRiskMap(projections, result)` — category surfaces → root causes → findings
- `buildRootCauseMap(projections, result)` — findings (left) → root causes (center) → actions (right)
- `buildAllMaps(projections, result)` → 3 map definitions

**Layout Strategy:**
Pre-computed positions using columnar layout. Root causes centered, findings left, actions right. Positions derived from node counts per group.

### MCP Layer Upgrades

#### New Tools (4)
| Tool | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `get_finding_projections` | FindingProjection[] | All findings with quantified impact, sorted by midpoint |
| `get_action_projections` | ActionProjection[] | All actions sorted by impact → confidence → severity |
| `get_workspace_projections` | WorkspaceProjection[] | 3 workspace projections with impact summaries |
| `get_map` | MapDefinition | Revenue leakage, chargeback risk, or root cause map |

#### McpAnswer Navigation
- `McpAnswer.navigation: McpAnswerNavigation | null` — NEW FIELD
- Contains: related_findings[], related_actions[], related_workspace, suggested_map, suggestions[]
- All 4 answer composers (scale, revenue, root_cause, fix_first) include navigation
- Suggestions like "View highest impact issues in Analysis", "Open revenue leakage map"

#### Context Layer
- `getProjections(ctx)` → full ProjectionResult
- `getFindingProjections(ctx)` → FindingProjection[]
- `getActionProjections(ctx)` → ActionProjection[]
- `getWorkspaceProjections(ctx)` → WorkspaceProjection[]
- `getMaps(ctx)` → MapDefinition[]
- `getMap(ctx, mapType)` → MapDefinition | null

### UI Surface Upgrades

- **Summary Cards:** Total Findings, Est. Monthly Loss (with midpoint), High Impact (>$10k), Avg Confidence
- **Filters:** Severity + Pack (replaces old type filter)
- **Drawer Structure:** Summary → Value Case → Impact Breakdown (monthly range, midpoint, % of revenue, impact type, confidence) → Reasoning → Root Cause → Surface + Details
- All findings sorted by impact midpoint descending

#### Actions Page (Rewritten)
- **Columns:** #, Action (with root cause), Severity, Est. Impact (range), Confidence, Scope (cross-pack/single)
- **Summary Cards:** Total Actions, Total Impact Addressable, Cross-Pack, High Severity
- **Sorting:** PRIMARY impact midpoint, SECONDARY confidence, TERTIARY severity
- **Drawer:** What This Fixes → Impact Unlocked (range, midpoint, priority score) → Root Cause → Scope → Verification button

#### Workspaces Page (Rewritten)
- **Workspace Cards:** Each card shows Monthly Loss (midpoint + range), Issues count, Confidence, Top Issue
- **Summary Cards per workspace:** Total Monthly Loss, Highest Impact Issue, Issues Found, Confidence
- **Findings Table:** Finding (with root cause), Severity, Est. Impact, Confidence, Surface
- **3 Workspace Types:** Preflight, Revenue Analysis, Chargeback Analysis

#### Maps Page (NEW)

- Each MCP answer now shows "Explore" section with contextual navigation
- Navigation targets: workspace view, suggested map, analysis page, actions page

#### Sidebar (Updated)
- Added "Maps" nav item with map icon between Analysis and Settings

### New Component: `ImpactBadge`
- `ImpactBadge` — shows "$2.3k – $7.8k/mo" range format with color coding (red >$5k, amber >$1k, zinc)
- `ImpactValue` — shows formatted single value with color coding
- Reused across Analysis, Actions, Workspaces, and Drawer components

### MCP Client Additions

## v1.0 — 2026-03-26 — Quantified Decision Engine

### What changed
Every finding, inference, and decision now carries a quantified financial impact. The system transforms from "here's what's wrong" to "here's what's wrong and how much it costs."

### New Package: `/packages/impact`

#### Impact Types (`types.ts`)
- `QuantifiedValueCase` — cause, effect, impact_type, estimated_impact (ALWAYS numeric), reasoning, basis_type, confidence, inference_key
- `EstimatedImpact` — monthly_revenue_delta, percentage_delta, range (min/max, NEVER null), currency
- `BusinessInputs` — monthly_revenue, AOV, transactions, conversion_rate, chargeback_rate, churn_rate
- `ImpactSummary` — total_monthly_loss_range, total_monthly_loss_mid, highest_impact_issue, issue_count, average_confidence
- `ImpactCategory` — revenue_loss, conversion_loss, chargeback_risk, traffic_waste, lifetime_value_loss

#### Heuristic Baselines (`baselines.ts`)
16 baseline entries covering all inference types across 3 packs:

| Category | Inferences Covered | Base Impact Range |
|---|---|---|
| Scale readiness | trust_boundary, policy_gap, checkout_integrity, revenue_path, measurement | 1-35% of revenue |
| Revenue integrity | conversion_flow, friction, leakage, trust_break, blindspot, clarity | 1-30% of revenue |
| Chargeback | refund_gap, support, expectation, dispute_risk | 0.5-18% chargeback rate increase |

Each baseline has high/medium/low severity ranges and specifies the base metric (revenue, transactions, chargeback_rate).

#### Estimation Engine (`engine.ts`)
- `estimateImpact(inferences, businessInputs)` → `QuantifiedValueCase[]`
- `summarizeImpact(valueCases)` → `ImpactSummary`

**Estimation formula:**
```
estimated_loss = baseline_percentage × business_scale × confidence_weight
```

**Rules enforced:**
- ALWAYS returns numeric range — never null
- If no business inputs → uses conservative fallback ($50k/mo SMB)
- Fallback inputs: confidence reduced by 40%, ranges widened by 50%
- Basis marked as `heuristic` vs `mixed` based on input source
- Higher severity → wider percentage range
- Negative/false inferences produce no value cases

### Integration into Pipeline
- `MultiPackInput` now accepts optional `business_inputs`
- `MultiPackResult` now includes `impact: { value_cases, summary }`
- Impact computed after all packs + intelligence, using shared inferences
- `recomputeAll` produces quantified impact alongside decisions

### MCP Answer Upgrade
- `McpAnswer` now includes `impact_summary: McpImpactSummary | null`
- `McpImpactSummary`: total_monthly_loss_range, total_monthly_loss_mid, highest_impact_issue, highest_impact_value, confidence_level, currency
- All 4 answer composers (scale, revenue, root cause, fix-first) include impact
- Inline returns (no-issues cases) also include impact_summary

### Test Coverage (`tests/impact.test.ts` — 17 tests, 6 suites)
- **Quantification Always Present (3)**: all cases have numeric range, no vague outputs, negative inferences excluded
- **Business Input Scaling (3)**: higher revenue = higher absolute impact, deterministic, severity ordering
- **Fallback Heuristics (3)**: no inputs still quantifies, lower confidence, wider ranges
- **Impact Aggregation (2)**: summary totals correct, empty cases → zero
- **Pipeline Integration (2)**: recomputeAll includes impact, business_inputs scales correctly
- **MCP Answer Impact (2)**: answers include impact_summary, monetary values present

### Total Test Count: 252 (100+36+25+35+19+20+17) across 51 suites — ALL PASSING

### Files Added

## v0.9 — 2026-03-26 — Chargeback Resilience Pack

### The system now answers 5 business questions
| Pack | Question |
|---|---|
| `scale_readiness_pack` | "Can I scale traffic?" |
| `revenue_integrity_pack` | "Where am I losing money?" |
| `chargeback_resilience_pack` | **"Am I exposed to chargebacks?"** (NEW) |
| Intelligence layer | "What is the underlying cause?" / "What should I fix first?" |

### Core principle
Chargeback is NOT a payment problem. It is a trust problem, expectation problem, communication problem, and policy problem. Every signal and inference answers: "Does this increase dispute risk?"

### New Signals (2 categories, 7 signals)

**Support** (`SignalCategory.Support`):
- `contact_method_present` — are contact channels detectable? (email, phone, form, whatsapp)
- `no_contact_method` — no contact method found at all
- `support_visibility_low` — contact exists but no dedicated contact/support page

**Expectation** (`SignalCategory.Expectation`):
- `refund_policy_accessible` — is there a dedicated refund/return policy page?
- `shipping_policy_present` — is there a shipping/delivery policy?
- `pricing_not_visible` — checkout exists but no pricing page
- `no_post_purchase_guidance` — no thank-you/confirmation page

### New Inferences (4 rules)

| Inference Key | Category | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `refund_policy_gap` | RefundPolicyRisk | Is the refund process clear enough to prevent disputes? |
| `support_unreachable` | SupportAccessibility | Can customers resolve issues without filing chargebacks? |
| `expectation_misalignment` | ExpectationAlignment | Are customer expectations properly set pre- and post-purchase? |
| `dispute_risk_elevated` | DisputeRisk | Composite: how many structural dispute factors are present? |

Each requires checkout context (no chargeback inferences without commerce).

### Extended Risk Model
- Chargeback inferences scored conservatively (lower base than scale/revenue) to avoid inflating other packs
- **Correlated group**: `refund_policy_gap` + `dispute_risk_elevated` → max (same evidence base)
- Scores: refund_policy_gap (0-18), support_unreachable (0-12), expectation_misalignment (0-10), dispute_risk_elevated (0-18)

### Chargeback Resilience Decision Pack
Question key: `is_chargeback_pressure_elevated`

| Outcome | When | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `high_chargeback_risk` | Critical/BlockLaunch impact | Risk → Incident |
| `moderate_chargeback_risk` | FixBeforeScale impact | Risk → Incident |
| `low_chargeback_risk` | Optimize impact | State → Observation |
| `chargeback_resilience_strong` | Observe impact | State → Observation |

### Chargeback-Oriented Actions
- `add_refund_policy` — single most effective chargeback prevention measure
- `add_support_channels` — customers who can reach support don't file disputes
- `clarify_pricing_and_confirmation` — expectation misalignment drives "unauthorized charge" disputes
- `review_checkout_brand_continuity` — brand disconnect creates charge confusion

### Chargeback Analysis Workspace (`chargeback-workspace.ts`)
- `ChargebackContext`: risk_level, risk_factors[], policy_gaps[], support_gaps[]
- `ChargebackSummary`: where_disputes_happen[], what_creates_refund_pressure[]
- Findings scoped to chargeback-relevant actions

### Intelligence Layer Integration
- 3 new root cause mappings:
  - `refund_policy_gap` → `policy_deficiency` (shared with scale pack)
  - `support_unreachable` → `support_gap` (new root cause)
  - `expectation_misalignment` → `expectation_failure` (new root cause)
  - `dispute_risk_elevated` → `elevated_dispute_risk` (new root cause)
- New `ImpactDimension`: `chargeback_risk`
- New `RootCauseCategory` values: `support_gap`, `expectation_failure`, `dispute_exposure`
- Cross-pack linking: `policy_deficiency` now affects scale + chargeback; `trust_failure` affects all 3

### Test Coverage (`tests/chargeback.test.ts` — 20 tests, 5 suites)
- Chargeback Signals (5): contact methods, no contact, refund policy present/absent, pricing visibility
- Chargeback Inferences (6): refund gap, support unreachable, expectation misalignment, dispute risk, no-checkout guard, reasoning
- Chargeback Decisions (4): all outcomes, meaningful actions, independence from other packs
- Chargeback Workspace (2): risk factors from inferences, clean workspace
- Multi-Pack Coexistence (3): recomputeAll includes chargeback, 3 packs coexist, root causes map to intelligence

### Total Test Count: 235 (100+36+25+35+19+20) across 45 suites — ALL PASSING

### Files Added

## v0.8 — 2026-03-26 — Verification Execution Layer

### The loop is now closed
```
decision → action → verification request → execution → new evidence → recomputation → updated decision
```

User clicks "Verify" → system executes probe → evidence is created → decisions update → UI reflects change.

### What was built

#### Verification Types (`workers/verification/types.ts`)
- `VerificationResult` — status, evidence[], evidence_refs, logs, duration_ms, errors
- `VerificationRun` — execution instance with attempt tracking
- `VerificationLog` — structured log entries (timestamp, level, message)
- `VerificationExecutor` — pluggable interface: `execute(input) → output`
- `ExecutorInput` — request, subject_url, scoping, cycle_ref, existing_evidence
- `ExecutorOutput` — status, evidence[], logs, errors

#### Executors (`workers/verification/executors.ts`)

| Executor | Status | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ReuseOnlyExecutor` | Implemented | Re-evaluates existing evidence without network calls. Refreshes freshness timestamps. |
| `LightProbeExecutor` | Implemented | Minimal HTTP probe: status code, redirects, headers, basic HTML. Generates HttpResponse + Redirect + PageContent evidence. |
| `BrowserVerificationExecutor` | Stub | Returns structured failure with "not available" message. Interface-compatible for future Playwright-MCP. |
| `IntegrationPullExecutor` | Stub | Returns structured failure. Interface-compatible for future API integrations. |

Executor design:
- All implement `VerificationExecutor` interface — pluggable by type
- Verification evidence tagged with `quality_score: 80` (higher than ingestion's 55-70)
- Evidence keys prefixed with `verification_` for traceability
- HTML parsing reuses existing `parsePage` from ingestion — no duplication

#### Orchestrator (`workers/verification/orchestrator.ts`)
- `VerificationOrchestrator` class managing the full lifecycle
- `submit(request)` — accepts a VerificationRequest, idempotent (ignores duplicates)
- `execute(requestId)` — dispatches to correct executor, tracks runs, stores evidence, updates status. Idempotent (returns cached result on re-call).
- `executeAndRecompute(requestId)` — executes + runs `recomputeAll` with all evidence (original + verification). Returns both verification result and updated MultiPackResult.
- Status transitions: pending → executing → completed/failed
- Run tracking with attempt counting + max retries config
- Failure handling: structured errors, logged per run

#### MCP Server Extension (`apps/mcp/server.ts`)
- Server now owns `EvidenceStore` + `VerificationOrchestrator`
- `loadContext()` initializes orchestrator alongside engine context
- `verify(params)` — convenience method: creates request → submits → executes → recomputes → returns status. The one-call closed loop.
- `executeVerification(requestId)` — execute + recompute + update context
- After verification, engine context is rebuilt from updated evidence store
- New tools: `get_verification_status`, `list_verifications`
- New resource: `vestigio://workspace/{workspace_ref}/verifications`

#### MCP Tool Additions
| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_verification_status` | Get status and result of a specific verification request |
| `list_verifications` | List all verification requests with statuses |

`VerificationStatusView` type: request_id, type, subject_ref, status, evidence_count, duration_ms, errors, completed_at

### Evidence Integration
- Verification evidence goes through `EvidenceStore.addMany()` — same pipeline as ingestion
- No overwriting: new evidence gets unique IDs (prefixed `vev_`)
- Tagged with `source_kind: HttpFetch`, `collection_method: StaticFetch`
- Versioned by cycle_ref
- Traceability: evidence_key includes `verification_` prefix

### Recomputation Trigger
After verification completes:
1. All evidence (original + verification) queried from store
2. `recomputeAll()` runs full pipeline: graph → signals → inference → decision → intelligence
3. Engine context rebuilt on MCP server
4. Subsequent MCP tool calls return updated decisions/actions/root causes

### Test Coverage (`tests/verification.test.ts` — 19 tests, 6 suites)
- **Reuse-Only Executor (3)**: refreshes freshness, handles no matching evidence, preserves IDs
- **Light Probe Executor (3)**: generates HTTP evidence, tags verification source, handles unreachable URLs
- **Browser Verification Stub (1)**: returns structured failure with pluggable interface
- **Orchestrator Lifecycle (5)**: execute + store, idempotency, duplicate rejection, run tracking, unknown ID
- **Closed-Loop Recomputation (2)**: recompute produces updated decisions, evidence store grows after probe
- **MCP Integration (5)**: verify() closed loop, list_verifications, get_verification_status, context updates, rejects without context

### Total Test Count: 215 (100 + 36 + 25 + 35 + 19) — ALL PASSING

### Files Added
```
workers/verification/types.ts         ← Domain model: VerificationResult, Run, Log, Executor interface

apps/mcp/tools.ts                     ← +2 tool definitions, +2 result types, verification dispatch
```

### Architecture: Tool-Ready for Future
```
VerificationOrchestrator
  └── executors (Map<VerificationType, VerificationExecutor>)
        ├── ReuseOnlyExecutor       ✓ implemented
        ├── LightProbeExecutor      ✓ implemented
        ├── BrowserVerificationExecutor  → future: Playwright-MCP adapter
        └── IntegrationPullExecutor      → future: API integrations
```
Adding a new executor = implement `VerificationExecutor` interface + register in orchestrator.

### Page Details

**Actions** — Global action queue from intelligence layer:
- SummaryCards: total actions, critical/high count, cross-pack count, root causes
- DataTable: priority, title+root cause, severity badge, type, cross-pack impact, confidence
- SideDrawer: summary, linked root cause card, impact dimensions, verification + resolve buttons

**Workspaces** — Contextual analysis views:
- Two workspace cards (Preflight + Revenue Analysis) with status badges and key metrics
- Clicking a card reveals detail view: workspace-specific SummaryCards + findings DataTable
- Finding rows open SideDrawer: description, severity, remediation, evidence count

**Analysis** — Global findings exploration:
- Filter bar: severity dropdown, type dropdown, clear button, filtered count
- Dynamic SummaryCards updating with filters
- DataTable: 6 columns (finding, severity, confidence, surface, impact, freshness)
- SideDrawer: summary, why it matters, evidence, remediation, root cause link

**Chat** — Cognitive interface:
- Left sidebar: conversation history list
- Main area: structured answer cards rendering McpAnswer shape (direct_answer, confidence badge, freshness badge, why bullets, next step, supporting refs, verification button)
- Bottom input bar with send handler

**Onboard** — Fast time-to-value wizard:

### Global UX Pattern (from UX_SURFACES.md)
- Tables everywhere for lists
- Row click → side drawer (not new page)
- Every drawer follows same structure: summary → why → evidence → remediation → actions
- No modal-heavy UX, no deep navigation trees
- Dense but readable tables, minimal visual noise, dark cyber aesthetic

### Test Results
- 196 engine tests — ALL PASSING (zero regression)
- Full vertical slice — ALL CHECKS PASSED

## v0.6 — 2026-03-26 — MCP Foundation Layer

### What was built
A complete MCP service layer at `/apps/mcp` — the cognitive interface between the engine and future chat/UI surfaces. MCP consumes canonical engine outputs, composes business-facing answers, and follows the execution policy defined in [MCP_MODEL.md](docs/MCP_MODEL.md).

### Architecture: MCP is NOT the brain
```
User / Chat UI  →  MCP  →  Engine (decisions, intelligence, evidence)
                    ↓
              Verification Requests (emitted, not executed)
```
MCP retrieves, composes, scopes, and explains. It never computes new decisions, mutates evidence, or runs collection directly.

### MCP Server (`server.ts`)
- `McpServer` class — library-style callable (network transport in future phases)
- `loadContext(evidence, scope, cycle_ref, domain, landing_url)` — runs engine pipeline via `recomputeAll`
- `callTool(name, params)` — dispatches to typed tool handlers
- `listTools()` / `listResources()` — capability discovery
- Configurable via `McpServerConfig` (conversion_proximity, is_production)

### Typed Contracts (`types.ts`)
**Request contracts:**
- `McpRequestScope` — workspace_ref, environment_ref, subject_ref, path_scope
- `McpToolRequest<P>` — typed tool invocations with scope

**Response contracts:**
- `McpAnswer` — direct_answer, confidence, freshness, staleness_reason, why[], recommended_next_step, supporting_refs, optional_verification
- `VerificationSuggestion` — verification_type, reason, expected_benefit

**Resource views (typed read-only projections):**
- `WorkspaceSummaryView` — packs, root causes, prioritized actions, overall health, confidence, freshness
- `PackSummaryView` — per-pack decision status
- `RootCauseSummaryView` — root cause with inference count
- `ActionSummaryView` — prioritized action with root cause link
- `DecisionExplainabilityView` — full decision explainability with why, actions, linked root causes
- `PreflightStatusView` — readiness score, blockers, risks
- `RevenueIntegritySummaryView` — leakage points, trust issues, measurement gaps
- `GraphPathSummaryView` — structural summary without raw dump

**Tool extensibility contracts:**
- `ToolCapability` — tool_id, name, description, input_schema, available, cost_level
- `ToolExecutionRequest` / `ToolExecutionResult` — future runtime tool adapter interface
- `McpResourceDefinition` / `McpToolDefinition` — registration types

### Context Assembler (`context.ts`)
Bridge between MCP and engine. Runs `recomputeAll` and exposes typed accessors:
- `assembleContext()` — builds engine context from evidence + scope
- `getScaleDecision()` / `getRevenueDecision()` / `getAllDecisions()`
- `getIntelligence()` / `getRootCauses()` / `getGlobalActions()`
- `getOverallFreshness()` — aggregates freshness across packs

### Resource Providers (`resources.ts`)
7 resource providers that project engine outputs into typed views:
- `getWorkspaceSummary()` — full workspace health with packs, root causes, actions
- `getDecisionExplainability(packKey)` — decision drill-down with linked root causes
- `getPreflightStatus()` — readiness assessment
- `getRevenueIntegritySummary()` — revenue leakage analysis
- `getRootCausesSummary()` — all root causes
- `getPrioritizedActionsSummary()` — global action queue
- `getGraphPathSummary()` — evidence graph structure

### Tools (`tools.ts`)
12 registered tools:

| Tool | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `get_workspace_summary` | Resource | Full workspace health overview |
| `get_decision_explainability` | Resource | Deep explainability for a specific pack |
| `get_root_causes` | Resource | Underlying root causes across packs |
| `get_prioritized_actions` | Resource | Global deduplicated action queue |
| `get_preflight_status` | Resource | Scale readiness assessment |
| `get_revenue_integrity_summary` | Resource | Revenue leakage analysis |
| `get_graph_path_summary` | Resource | Evidence graph structure |
| `request_verification` | Action | Emit verification request (pending, not executed) |
| `answer_can_i_scale` | Answer | "Can I scale traffic?" |
| `answer_where_losing_money` | Answer | "Where am I losing money?" |
| `answer_underlying_cause` | Answer | "What is the underlying cause?" |
| `answer_fix_first` | Answer | "What should I fix first?" |

### Answer Composition (`answers.ts`)
Converts engine outputs into structured `McpAnswer` objects following MCP_MODEL.md rules:
- **Answer-first**: direct_answer leads, reasons follow
- **Confidence/freshness**: always surfaced, never hidden
- **No invention**: answers only what evidence supports
- **Reuse-first**: suggests verification only when needed (stale data or low confidence)
- **Verification suggestions**: light_probe for stale data, browser_verification for low-confidence material decisions

### Verification Bridge (`verification.ts`)
- `createVerificationRequest()` — emits `VerificationRequest` with status `pending`
- `validateVerificationRequest()` — validates inputs before creation
- Supports: reuse_only, light_probe, browser_verification, integration_pull
- Requests are emitted but NOT executed — orchestrator handles execution in future phases

### Tool-Readiness Architecture
Designed for future Claude + Playwright-MCP instrumentation:
- `ToolCapability` models tool metadata separately from execution
- `ToolExecutionRequest` / `ToolExecutionResult` model the adapter pattern
- Tool definitions use `input_schema` for future schema validation
- Business logic stays in engine — MCP only composes and dispatches
- No Claude-specific prompting hardcoded into business logic

### 7 Resource Definitions (URI-templated)
```
vestigio://workspace/{workspace_ref}/summary
vestigio://workspace/{workspace_ref}/pack/{pack_key}
vestigio://workspace/{workspace_ref}/root-causes
vestigio://workspace/{workspace_ref}/actions
vestigio://workspace/{workspace_ref}/preflight
vestigio://workspace/{workspace_ref}/revenue
vestigio://workspace/{workspace_ref}/graph
```

### Test Coverage (`tests/mcp.test.ts` — 35 tests, 7 suites)
- **Server Lifecycle (5)**: tool listing, resource listing, no-context error, unknown tool, context loading
- **Resource Retrieval (9)**: workspace summary, scale/revenue explainability, invalid pack, preflight, revenue, root causes, prioritized actions, graph
- **Business Question Answers (8)**: all 4 questions × clean + risky sites, confidence/freshness propagation
- **Verification Requests (5)**: light probe, browser verification, invalid subject, invalid reason, pending-not-executed
- **Answer Composition Quality (3)**: low-evidence verification suggestion, no-invention check, scope reflection
- **Determinism (2)**: same evidence → same answers, same workspace summary
- **Scenario: Broken Path (3)**: critical health, root causes present, negative scale answer

### Total Test Count: 196 (100 base + 36 revenue + 25 intelligence + 35 MCP) — ALL PASSING

### Files Added

```

### What the system is now ready for
- **Richer chat integration**: McpAnswer structure is composable for chat UIs
- **Future Playwright/browser verification**: ToolCapability + ToolExecutionRequest adapter pattern
- **Future MCP tool expansion**: tool definitions are declarative, tool executor is dispatch-based
- **Future decision packs**: `getDecisionExplainability` accepts any pack_key, workspace summary lists all packs dynamically
- **Claude orchestration**: response shapes are high-signal, context loading prefers summaries + refs over raw dumps

## v0.5 — 2026-03-26 — Decision Intelligence Layer

### What the system now answers
- **"Can I scale?"** → `scale_readiness_pack`
- **"Where am I losing money?"** → `revenue_integrity_pack`
- **"What is the underlying cause?"** → root cause analysis (NEW)
- **"What should I fix first?"** → global action prioritization (NEW)
- **"What affects both revenue and scale?"** → cross-pack linking (NEW)

### New Package: `/packages/intelligence`

#### Root Cause Model (`root-causes.ts`)
Inferences that describe the same structural problem collapse into a single RootCause. Each inference belongs to at most one root cause — no duplication.

**Root Cause Groups:**
| Root Cause Key | Category | Contributing Inferences | Affected Packs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `trust_failure_at_checkout` | trust_failure | trust_boundary_crossed, checkout_integrity, trust_break_in_checkout | scale + revenue |
| `fragmented_conversion_path` | conversion_fragmentation | revenue_path_fragile, conversion_flow_fragmented | scale + revenue |
| `friction_barrier_on_path` | friction_barrier | friction_on_critical_path | scale + revenue |
| `measurement_blindspot` | measurement_gap | measurement_coverage, measurement_blindspot | scale + revenue |
| `policy_deficiency` | policy_deficiency | policy_gap | scale + revenue |
| `active_revenue_leakage` | conversion_fragmentation | revenue_leakage | revenue |
| `weak_conversion_signal` | conversion_clarity | unclear_conversion_intent | revenue |

Each RootCause includes: category, title, description, contributing inferences/signals/evidence, aggregated severity + confidence, impact dimensions, affected packs.

**Aggregation rules:**
- Severity: takes highest from group, convergence bonus (+1 level if 3+ inferences point to same cause)
- Confidence: weighted average (higher severity = more weight), convergence bonus capped at +10
- Filtering: inferences with `conclusion_value=false/none` excluded (except `measurement_coverage='false'` which means insufficient)

#### Decision Linking (`linking.ts`)
Connects decisions to root causes via shared inference references.

**DecisionLink** includes:
- `decision_ref`, `decision_key`, `pack_key`
- `root_cause_refs[]` with `contribution_strength`: primary (≥50% inference overlap), contributing, related (evidence-only overlap)

Both packs can link to the same root cause — e.g., `trust_failure_at_checkout` affects both `scale_readiness_pack` and `revenue_integrity_pack`.

#### Global Action Prioritization (`linking.ts`)
Merges and prioritizes actions across all decision packs.

**GlobalAction** includes:
- `source_decisions[]` — which decisions produced this action
- `root_cause_ref` — which root cause this action addresses
- `cross_pack_impact` — how many packs benefit from this action (1 or 2)
- `merged_from[]` — original action refs that were deduplicated into this
- `expected_impact[]` — impact dimensions (scale_risk, revenue_loss, trust_erosion, measurement_blind)

**Priority formula:**
- Base priority from decision impact (1=incident, 2=block, 3=fix, 5=optimize, 8=observe)
- Cross-pack bonus: -2 if action helps multiple packs
- Severity bonus: -3 for critical root cause, -1 for high
- Verification penalty: +10 for verification actions
- Minimum priority: 1

**Deduplication:** Actions with normalized-equal titles across packs merge into a single GlobalAction.

#### Intelligence Engine (`engine.ts`)
Top-level orchestrator that produces `DecisionIntelligenceResult`:
1. Groups inferences into root causes
2. Links decisions to root causes
3. Deduplicates and prioritizes actions globally
4. Builds intelligence summary

**IntelligenceSummary** answers:
- `underlying_problems[]` — "What are the real problems?"
- `fix_first[]` — "What should be fixed first?" (top 3 non-verification actions)
- `cross_pack_issues[]` — "What affects both revenue and scale?"
- `highest_severity` — worst root cause severity
- `total_root_causes`, `total_global_actions`

### Integration into `recomputeAll`
- `MultiPackResult` now includes `intelligence: DecisionIntelligenceResult`
- Intelligence computed AFTER both packs produce their decisions and actions
- Shared pipeline: evidence → graph → signals → inferences → [scale decision + revenue decision] → intelligence layer
- Existing decision logic is completely untouched — intelligence reads outputs, never modifies inputs

### Test Coverage
- **Intelligence tests** (`tests/intelligence.test.ts`): 25 tests across 6 suites
  - Root Cause Grouping (8): trust grouping, measurement grouping, exclusion of negatives, no-duplication guarantee, sort order, convergence bonus, cross-pack identification, empty input
  - Decision Linking (2): shared inference links, cross-pack root cause connections
  - Action Deduplication & Prioritization (3): global sort, cross-pack priority boost, verification ranking
  - Intelligence Summary (3): problem listing, cross-pack issue identification, empty system
  - Intelligence E2E via recomputeAll (5): full pipeline, clean site, off-domain checkout, determinism, decision immutability
  - Edge Cases (4): single inference, low confidence, independent issues, impact dimensions
- **Total test count**: 161 tests (100 base + 36 revenue + 25 intelligence) — ALL PASSING
- **Zero regression**: existing packs, pipeline, and vertical slice all unchanged

## v0.4 — 2026-03-25 — Revenue Integrity Pack

### What the system now answers
- **"Can I scale?"** → `scale_readiness_pack` (existing)
- **"Where am I losing money?"** → `revenue_integrity_pack` (NEW)

### New Signals (3 categories, 10 signals)

**Revenue Flow** (`SignalCategory.Revenue`):
- `funnel_entry_detected` — is there a clear conversion path entry?
- `off_domain_checkout_revenue` — does checkout leave the domain?
- `redirect_before_checkout` — redirects before checkout with hop count
- `fragmented_conversion_path` — conversion scattered across multiple external hosts
- `missing_tracking_on_commercial` — no analytics on commercial pages

**Friction** (`SignalCategory.Friction`):
- `excessive_redirects` — total redirect hops > 3 across site
- `slow_critical_path` — pages with response > 2s on revenue path
- `broken_form_action` — forms posting to URLs returning errors
- `domain_switch_without_context` — handoffs to unknown external domains

**Clarity** (`SignalCategory.Clarity`):
- `no_primary_conversion_path` — no checkout or payment forms detected
- `multiple_competing_ctas` — pages with 3+ forms
- `missing_policy_near_checkout` — no policies near checkout flow

### New Inferences (6 rules)

| Inference Key | Category | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `conversion_flow_fragmented` | ConversionFlow | Is the conversion path structurally fragmented? |
| `friction_on_critical_path` | FrictionPath | Are there obstacles on the revenue path? |
| `revenue_leakage` | RevenueLeakage | Where is money actively being lost? |
| `trust_break_in_checkout` | TrustRevenue | Does trust break at the conversion point? |
| `measurement_blindspot` | MeasurementBlindspot | Can we even see the leakage? |
| `unclear_conversion_intent` | ConversionClarity | Can users find and trust the path to purchase? |

Each inference has: structured reasoning, contributing signals, confidence score, severity hint.

### Extended Risk Model
- Revenue inferences scored in `inferenceToRisk()`: conversion_flow_fragmented (5-30), friction_on_critical_path (5-25), revenue_leakage (5-30), trust_break_in_checkout (5-25), measurement_blindspot (0-15), unclear_conversion_intent (0-20)
- **Correlated grouping** to prevent double-counting:
  - Trust group: trust_boundary_crossed + checkout_integrity + trust_break_in_checkout → max
  - Revenue flow group: conversion_flow_fragmented + revenue_leakage → max
  - Friction group: friction_on_critical_path + revenue_path_fragile → max

### Revenue Integrity Decision Pack
Question key: `is_there_revenue_leakage_in_high_intent_paths`

| Outcome | When | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `revenue_leakage_detected` | Critical/BlockLaunch impact | Risk → Incident |
| `revenue_at_risk` | FixBeforeScale impact | Risk → Incident |
| `revenue_path_fragile` | Optimize impact | State → Observation |
| `revenue_integrity_stable` | Observe impact | State → Observation |

Each decision includes: structured why, contributing inferences, severity, confidence, human-readable summary, primary/secondary/verification actions.

### Revenue-Oriented Actions
- `fix_checkout_flow` / `close_revenue_leak_points` — for critical leakage
- `consolidate_conversion_path` — reduce fragmentation
- `restore_trust_at_checkout` — add policies, verify providers
- `reduce_critical_path_friction` — fix forms, speed up pages
- `improve_measurement` — install analytics on commercial pages
- `clarify_conversion_intent` — establish clear primary CTA
- `monitor_conversion_rate` — verification actions

### Revenue Analysis Workspace (`revenue-workspace.ts`)
- `RevenueContext`: estimated_risk_level, leakage_points[], trust_issues[], measurement_gaps[]
- `RevenueSummary`: where_money_is_lost[], what_to_fix_first[], confidence_score, risk_score
- Findings scoped to revenue-relevant actions only
- References decision, is recomputable, does not store derived logic

### Multi-Pack Recomputation (`recomputeAll`)
- Shared pipeline: evidence → graph → signals → inferences (computed ONCE)
- Each pack produces independent: decision → actions → workspace
- `MultiPackInput` / `MultiPackResult` types for multi-pack analysis
- Both packs coexist without conflict — tested

### Domain Enum Extensions
- `SignalCategory`: +Revenue, +Friction, +Clarity
- `InferenceCategory`: +ConversionFlow, +FrictionPath, +RevenueLeakage, +TrustRevenue, +MeasurementBlindspot, +ConversionClarity
- `REVENUE_INTEGRITY_PACK` constant added to `decision.ts`

### Test Coverage
- **Revenue tests** (`tests/revenue.test.ts`): 36 tests across 7 suites
  - Revenue Signals (9): funnel entry, off-domain checkout, redirect before checkout, fragmented path, excessive redirects, slow critical path, no conversion path, clean funnel
  - Revenue Inferences (9): flow fragmentation, friction, leakage, trust break, measurement blindspot, unclear intent, clean signals, reasoning validation
  - Revenue Decision Engine (5): all 4 outcomes + independence from scale_readiness
  - Revenue Actions (2): fix actions for leakage, monitoring for stable
  - Revenue Workspace (4): leakage points, clean site, measurement gaps, decision reference
  - Multi-Pack Coexistence (4): both packs from same evidence, different decisions, coexistence, shared signals
  - Revenue E2E Scenarios (3): off-domain+no-policies, clean funnel, broken conversion path
- **Existing tests**: 100 tests, 14 suites — ALL STILL PASSING (zero regression)

### Files Changed/Added

## v0.3 — 2026-03-25 — System Hardening

### Bug Fixes (CRITICAL)
- **Inference byAttribute data loss**: Changed `Map<string, Signal>` (last-writer-wins) to `Map<string, Signal[]>` — multiple signals per attribute are now preserved
- **Dead checkout_detected logic in inferPolicyGap**: Removed broken `checkout_detected !== 'false'` check (signal only emitted with `'false'`). Commerce detection now correctly uses `checkout.mode` and `provider.guess` signals
- **Double-counting in revenue path fragility**: Removed `trust.boundary_crossed` from `inferRevenuePathFragility` — it was double-counting with `checkout.off_domain` (always co-emitted). Off-domain checkout alone now contributes 30 pts instead of 55
- **Double-counting in checkout integrity**: Removed `trust.boundary_crossed` from `inferCheckoutIntegrity` — redundant with `checkout.off_domain`. Adjusted off-domain deduction to 35 to compensate
- **Risk score inflation**: Risk evaluator now groups correlated inferences (`trust_boundary_crossed` + `checkout_integrity`) and takes max instead of sum. Revenue path fragile contribution reduced from 25 to 20 for high
- **Content-type guard in ingestion**: Fixed null `content_type` falling through to HTML parsing. Now explicitly checks `content_type != null && content_type.includes('text/html')`
- **workspace.ts broken `nextId` references**: Fixed 2 remaining `nextId('pfe')` and `nextId('fnd')` calls left from partial ID generator migration

### Non-Determinism Fixes
- **Scoped ID generators**: Created `packages/domain/id.ts` with `IdGenerator` class — replaces all module-level global counters. Every engine now creates a fresh `IdGenerator` per invocation, producing deterministic IDs (`sig_1`, `sig_2`, ...) independent of process state
- **Affected modules**: `graph/builder.ts`, `signals/engine.ts`, `inference/engine.ts`, `risk/evaluator.ts`, `decision/engine.ts`, `actions/deriver.ts`, `workspace/workspace.ts`
- **Graph determinism**: Two calls to `buildGraph` with identical inputs now produce identical node IDs

### Graph Hardening
- **Asset node deduplication**: `processScript` and `processIframe` now use `getOrCreateAssetNode` — same script URL appearing on multiple pages creates only 1 asset node (was creating N)
- **Policy node deduplication**: `processPolicyPage` now uses `getOrCreatePolicyNode` — same policy URL creates 1 node
- **Endpoint deduplication**: Form endpoints deduplicated via `nodesByKey` map
- **Separate `nodesByKey` map**: Providers, assets, endpoints, and policies use a dedicated `nodesByKey` map instead of polluting `nodesByUrl`
- **Edge index**: `BuiltGraph` now maintains `edgeIndex: Map<string, GraphEdge[]>` for O(1) `getEdgesFrom()` lookups. BFS traversal performance improved from O(nodes × edges) to O(nodes + edges)

### Ingestion Hardening
- **Dynamic quality_score**: Replaced hardcoded `quality_score: 70` with `computeQualityScore()` — scores based on response time, status code, and collection method baseline
- **URL deduplication normalization**: `discoverCandidates` now normalizes URLs (lowercase hostname, strip fragments, remove trailing slashes) before dedup
- **Priority common paths**: Common path probes (`/checkout`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, etc.) now added before discovered links and before the 20-URL slice limit — critical policy pages are never dropped

### Runtime Validation (`packages/domain/validation.ts`)
- `ValidationError` class with `entity`, `field`, `reason`
- `validateScoping()` — checks ref formats, non-empty strings
- `validateFreshness()` — checks Date objects, FreshnessState enum
- `validateEvidence()` — all required fields, score range, payload presence, nested scoping/freshness
- `validateSignal()` — confidence 0..100, evidence_refs format, category enum
- `validateInference()` — signal_refs, evidence_refs, reasoning non-empty
- `validateDecision()` — all enums, why.summary, actions, projections, primary_outcome literal

### Recomputation Model (`packages/workspace/recompute.ts`)
- `recompute(input: RecomputeInput): RecomputeResult` — runs full pipeline from evidence to workspace
- Takes: evidence[], scoping, cycle_ref, root_domain, landing_url, question_key, conversion_proximity, is_production
- Returns: graph_stats, signals, inferences, decision, risk_evaluation, actions, workspace
- Deterministic: same evidence + config produces same result
- Reflects new evidence: adding evidence to the input changes all downstream products

### Action Derivation Improvements
- Secondary actions now get `decision.why.summary` as description instead of empty string
- Verification actions now get `'Verification step to confirm resolution.'` as description

### Test Suite (`tests/all.test.ts` — 100 tests, 14 suites)
- **Domain Contracts** (8 tests): makeRef, parseRef, IdGenerator sequence/reset/independence, scoping, freshness
- **Runtime Validation** (12 tests): valid/invalid scoping, freshness, evidence, signal, inference, ref format
- **Evidence Store** (8 tests): add, addMany, getByRef, query by cycle/type, multiple items per URL, clear, missing ID

## v0.2 — 2026-03-25 — Full Vertical Slice Complete

### Phase 2: Evidence Graph (COMPLETED)
- Created `packages/graph/` with:
  - `types.ts`: GraphNode, GraphEdge, GraphNodeType, GraphEdgeType, PathResult, CommercialPathResult, TrustBoundaryResult, TrustGap
  - `builder.ts`: Builds graph from evidence — processes page content, redirects, scripts, forms, iframes, checkout indicators, provider indicators, policy pages. Creates nodes (page, host, endpoint, provider, policy_document, asset) and edges (redirect, script_src, iframe_src, form_action, intent_target, uses_provider, references_policy)
  - `query.ts`: GraphQuery with 11 query methods — commercial path, checkout posture, trust boundary, critical routes, providers, policies, external assets, redirect chains, node by URL, edges from/to, stats
  - `index.ts`: Public exports

### Phase 3: Signals + Inference (COMPLETED)
- Created `packages/signals/` with:
  - `engine.ts`: Signal extraction from evidence + graph. Extracts signals in 6 categories: Checkout (mode, off-domain, provider), Policy (privacy/terms/refund presence, coverage), Trust (boundary crossing, weak surface, redirect chains), Measurement (analytics coverage), Platform (detected platforms), Operational (slow responses, HTTP errors)
- Created `packages/inference/` with:
  - `engine.ts`: Inference computation from signals. 6 inference rules: commerce_context, trust_boundary_crossed, policy_gap, revenue_path_fragile, measurement_coverage, checkout_integrity. Each inference has reasoning, severity hint, and confidence.

### Phase 4: Risk + Decision Engine (COMPLETED)
- Created `packages/risk/` with:
  - `evaluator.ts`: Risk evaluation following RISK_ENGINE.md — raw risk score from inferences/signals, confidence computation, convergence scoring, gate result, severity thresholds (0-19 none, 20-39 low, 40-59 medium, 60-79 high, 80-100 critical), decision impact mapping with business context scaling (conversion proximity, production flag)
- Created `packages/decision/` with:
  - `engine.ts`: Decision engine for scale_readiness_pack. Produces decisions answering "is_it_safe_to_scale_traffic?" with outcomes: unsafe_to_scale_traffic, fix_before_scale, ready_with_risks, safe_to_scale. Full explainability (why, actions, summary). Action policy with primary/secondary/verification tiers.

### Actions + Workspace (COMPLETED)
- Created `packages/actions/` with:
  - `deriver.ts`: Derives typed actions from decisions — primary, secondary, verification. Maps decision category to action type, impact to priority.
- Created `packages/workspace/` with:
  - `workspace.ts`: Creates preflight workspace from decision + actions + inferences. Generates PreflightProfile, PreflightEvaluation (with blockers/risks/opportunities/summary), and Finding projections.

### Integration Test: Full Vertical Slice (PASSED)
- Created `test-vertical-slice.ts` — runs the complete pipeline: domain → ingestion → evidence → graph → signals → inference → risk → decision → actions → workspace
- **All 9 validation checks passed** against example.com:
  - ✔ Domain ingested (12 pages)
  - ✔ Evidence stored (24 items)
  - ✔ Graph built (13 nodes)
  - ✔ Signals generated (7 signals)
  - ✔ Inferences created (4 inferences)
  - ✔ scale_readiness decision produced
  - ✔ Actions derived (3 actions)
  - ✔ Workspace created (preflight type)
  - ✔ Cycle completed
